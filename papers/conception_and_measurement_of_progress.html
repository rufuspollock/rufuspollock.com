				It is desired to evaluate the impact of an economic policy. But before we even enter into modelling and discussion of particular actions a consensus needs to exist as to how we determine what a good or a bad outcome is. How to determine that one policy leads to better situation than another. A conception of progress - and some way to measure it - is needed. Different ethical and value systems can lead to radically different goals. A Rousseauian intellectual might consider the distance from the pastoral idyll, the Marxist the progress towards the Proletarian revolution and the Hedonist the amount of leisure. More commonly we see standard of living indices or even measures of GDP offered about as yardsticks for advancement. There is no right answer to these questions. Each system is, by its own lights, correct. However there is a common thread. Almost all of them promote freedom (though one defined in different ways) and the happiness they believe to be its concomitant.
			</p>
			<p>
				Economists come at this question from two angles. The theoretical and the empirical. The theoretical begins with a general concept of utility (or welfare) for the individual and attempts to extrapolate to society. This concept can be made wide enough to include almost any conception of what progress is or should be. However as it does so it conflicts with the other main requirement for an economist: measurability. An economist is above all an empiricist. She or he wishes to be able to decide and talk about issues and policies in the real world. Thus we would like to have, at the very least, an \emph{approximate} way of measuring progress there. Of having an indicator that is computable. From this point of view advancement towards the proletarian revolution is a difficult conception of progress because it is so difficult to measure. Hence the strong attractions of crude measures such as GDP - it is computable (roughly - there are plenty of difficulties even to obtain an accurate estimate of GDP).
			</p>

				There is more to it than that. GDP (or similar indicators) are thought to be strongly correlated with other indices of quality of living (such as the Human Development Index (HDI) used by the UN, measures of people living in poverty). For example the number of people living in absolute poverty tends to drop one for one with growth in aggregate income (roughly GDP) (see \cite{fischer_2003} p.13). Second, and this is the more important point. It is considered that these indicators correspond to a conception of progress that commands widespread assent (though with some very noticeable exceptions) in the world and especially in the west. This is by no means an entirely materialistic viewpoint. But it is one that sees many of the other freedoms considered valuable as dependent on or facilitated by greater wealth. (Note almost all indicators used today will include values for items such as environmental quality. And, again, above a certain point, GDP is correlated with improving environmental standards [Cite: EKC literature, JEL article on Econ and Environment])

		<blockquote>
			Technological progress is defined as the ability to extract more or better outputs from a given level of effort, equipment, fuel and other inputs. It is thus an improvement in the efficiency of our control of the physical environment, replacing known ways of putting food on the table and clothes on the body with better ones. 'Better' here is defined purely from teh consumer's point of view: it means that innovation makes goods cheaper, better, longer-lasting or more pleasing in some other way for the consumer. \emph{This definition looks at the totality of the effect of change: if a change in technology can improve food output only by poisoning the ground water more cautious evaluations of `progress' must be employed.} [emphasis added] The consumer's point of view (`maximising utility') is not the only way of looking at the industrial revolution or indeed any case of technological progress, though it is the most natural to modern economists. Marx, by contrast, was far more interested in the effects of technology on the labourer than on the consumer. While this is a legitimate point of view, it is not the one adopted here. As Adam Smith noted, 'consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; the interest of the producer ought to be attended to only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer [Wealth of Nations 1776: II, 660]'

			During the 1980s national accounting methodology emerged as an important subject in economics departments and scholars debated alternative conceptualizations fo teh issues. One school of thought, represented by Simon Kuznets (1941), Joseph Davis (1945), and Merilll K. Bennett (1937) urged the creation of welfare meausres that would reflect the satisfaction of consumers. Arguing that a welfare measure might begin with national income, Kuznets proposed numerous refinements to incorporate nonmarket activities, occupational costs, leisure, costs of urban civilization, and inequality. Ultimately many practical consideration were involved and given pressures to combat unemployment during the Depression, the Commerce Department followed a narrower approach by defining national product as the market value of the output of final goods and services produced by the nation's economy. Though it had recognized shortcomings, per capita GNP soon emerged as a widely used measure of living standards.
