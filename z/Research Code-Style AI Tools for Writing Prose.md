This research concerns AI-assisted *writing* tools that are **structurally analogous to modern AI coding environments** (e.g. Codex CLI, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Windsurf): tools that work *in situ* on an existing corpus, integrate with the author’s editor or filesystem, and support iterative, skill-based workflows.

The focus is explicitly **not** on coding, but on the creation and editing of **prose**: essays, long-form nonfiction, books, novels, screenplays, research synthesis, and related textual forms.

In short: tools that do for writing what AI-native coding tools now do for code.

### Objective

Identify and characterise existing systems that enable AI-assisted writing workflows which:

1. Operate directly on a user’s **existing content base** (local Markdown/text files, folders, repos, or live documents).
2. Support **in-place editing** via the user’s editor (CLI, IDE, or document editor), rather than a standalone chat interface.
3. Allow **configurable behaviours / “skills” / workflows** (prompt templates, roles, multi-step processes), analogous to coding agents.
4. Maintain task or conversational continuity across edits, similar to agentic coding flows.
5. Can either be **repurposed from code-centric tools** or are **purpose-built for prose**, without requiring speculative design.

### Scope

* Tools that already exist (commercial, open-source, or experimental).
* Tools that can be *repurposed* from code-oriented workflows (e.g. Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI) for prose writing.
* Local-first or local-corpus-aware systems are prioritised.
* Explicitly excludes speculative designs, mockups, or purely conceptual frameworks.

### Core Questions

1. What existing tools meet the criteria above (editor/CLI integration + local content context)?
2. How do these tools load and manage context (single document vs corpus)?
3. What notions of “skills,” workflows, or reusable behaviours do they support?
4. How do they support iterative editing and continuity over time?
5. Which interfaces dominate (CLI, editor plugin, desktop app, hybrid)?
6. What are the practical limits (context windows, corpus size, configuration friction)?

### Deliverables

* A structured comparison table covering: tool, interface mode, local context support, workflow/skills model, prose readiness.
* A typology of approaches (repurposed coding agents vs prose-native systems).
* Use-case mappings (essays, books, research synthesis, social posts).
* Notes on practical repurposing of Codex / Claude Code / Gemini-style tools for prose.
