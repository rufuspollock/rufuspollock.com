The Public Domain Review is an online journal and not-for-profit project dedicated to the exploration of curious and compelling works from the history of art, literature, and ideas.

<!--more-->In particular, as the sugggests, the focus is on works which have now fallen into the public domain, that vast commons of out-of-copyright material that everyone is free to enjoy, share, and build upon without restriction.

Our aim is to promote and celebrate the public domain in all its abundance and variety, and help our readers explore its rich terrain â€“ like a small exhibition gallery at the entrance to an immense network of archives and storage rooms that lie beyond.
