    Examples
  </h2>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h2>Music</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reuse either explicit or implicit is ubiquitous</li>
    <li>Dance and hip-hop: explicit 'sampling' is the basis of the genre</li>
    <li>All composers whether classical or modern reuse previous musical, ideas, motifs, and melodies</li>
    <li>Should have to license those recordings actually used in the 'release'</li> 
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h2>Software</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A new 'app' will likely combine many ideas (and even code) from previous products.</li>
    <li>Ideas can only come from applications that one has encountered (sampled)</li>
    <li>May try out many different approaches in the prototype</li>
    <li>Will only license (if at all) once nearing 'production'</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h2>
    Documentary Films
  </h2>
  <p>
    <q>[The] 90-minute documentary [Wanderlust] ... was also a window into the frustrations of making a clip-intensive film dependent on copyright clearance, which has become hugely expensive in the past decade. Initial quotations for the necessary sequences came to more than $450,000, which would have raised by half the cost of the IFC film. ... "Paramount wanted $20,000 for 119 seconds of 'Paper Moon,' " Ms. Sams said. "The studios are so afraid of exploitation that they set boundaries no one will cross. Even after the prices were cut, we were $150,000 in the hole."</q> (from the NY Times <em>No Free Samples for Documentaries: Seeking Film Clips With the Fair-Use Doctrine</em>)

<div class="slide">
  <h2>
    Framework
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Cumulativeness: New innovations reuse old 
    </li>
    <li>
    Rights regime: With IP rights second-stage innovators have to license (without them no restrictions on reuse).
    </li>
    <li>
      Licensing transfers rents from second-stage to first-stage and enables some first-stage innovations which would not be profitable otherwise</li>
    <li>Imperfect information: licensing isn't perfect and giving out IP rights can result in hold-up</li>
    <li>Sampling: new innovators can only use innovations they have encountered through some form of sampling (search and trialling).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>
    Solving
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>With IP: set either high or low royalty. Under high royalty there is holdup: low value 2nd stage innovations don't happen</li>
    <li>High royalty chosen if probability of a high value innovation is high (p is low)</li>
    <li>
    WELFARE: Under high royalty comparing IP to no IP there is a trade off between:
    <ul>
      <li>Hold-up costs (second stage innovations that do not happen)</li>
      <li>Extra first stage (and dependent second-stage) innovation because of licensing revenues</li>
    </ul>

    Conclusion
  </h2>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h2>Basic Model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The presence of intellectual property rights can lead to holdup of second stage innovation</li>
    <li>Trade this off against more 1st stage (and dependent 2nd stage) innovation</li>
    <li>Need to keep in mind that we care about welfare not innovation: very fact transfers are needed indicates that some of licensing revenue is used for first stage costs</li>
  </ul>
</div>


<div class="slide">
  <h2>Sampling Model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The presence of intellectual property rights may restrict the level of sampling below what would be socially optimal.</li>
    <li>There is a trade-off between the benefits of transferring revenue to first-stage innovators and the costs in terms of fewer second stage innovations (with higher average cost).</li>
    <li>The lower the cost of sampling and the greater the differential between low and high second-stage costs the more likely it is that a regime <em>without</em> intellectual property rights will be preferable.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h2>Take Away</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Technological change which reduces the cost of encountering and trialling new 'ideas' implies a <em>reduction</em> in the socially optimal level of intellectual property rights such as patents and copyright.</li>
    <li>Examples of such technological change in recent years include the advances in computers and communications which have:
    <ul>
      <li>dramatically reduced the cost of accessing and reusing cultural material such as music and film</li>
      <li>greatly increased the number of 'ideas' that a software developer can encounter and trial</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
