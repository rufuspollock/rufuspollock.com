Life Itself Practicum is a practice ground for living and working towards a radically wiser world.

### Is it a job, training, or internship?

It has elements of all three and is distinct from any one of them on their own.

We are inviting people into a three-month immersive experience at one of Life Itself’s hubs, where you live in community and contribute roughly 20 hours per week in service. That might include helping with communications, coordination, events, land and building maintenance, or other hands-on tasks needed to sustain Life Itself.

This is not a conventional job or internship – we expect more self-management, initiative, and presence than most internships would require. Nor is it a training programme, though you’ll almost certainly learn and grow a lot. You’ll be surrounded by people with experience in community living, regenerative culture, practical spirituality, and mission-driven work. A good part of your learning will happen through doing, observing, and reflecting.

We see this as a practicum of service where your contribution supports Life Itself, and in return you are have a place to live and given a context to develop skills, inner and outer, that are key for a new paradigm. It's also a try-out for any future collaboration.
