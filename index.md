## Cultivating Clarity in Complexity

Our world stands at a civilisational threshold. The same intelligence that built systems of unprecedented reach now strains under their weight. Beneath the economic, ecological, and technological crises lies a quieter fracture — a crisis of *sense*: how we perceive, value, and make meaning together.

My work traces this line between **inner and outer transformation**. From open knowledge infrastructures to cultural and spiritual renewal, I explore how shifts in consciousness, culture and systems can radically realign our civilization.

This site itself is both **portal and garden** — a place to share ideas, experiments, and reflections on how we might move toward a wiser world.
Some pages are germs of ideas, others are fully-fledged projects.

## Wisdom in the service of transformation

At heart, I am a *sensemaker* and *pragmatic utopian* — making sense of the world and committed to practical action in service of a radically wiser world.

These two streams inter-are: making sense informs action and practical implementation gives meaning to sensemaking. Inquiry and reflection come first. And I want them to inform -- and be woven with -- engagement with the world -- and engagement with a context of action at the roots, action for paradigmatic change. It will be no surprise that I have been deeply inspired by Thich Nhat Hanh and the vision of Engaged Buddhism.

## Areas of Work

My work spans several fields from research and policy-making to digital infrastructure and social innovation. Despite this diversity there is a common thread: a commitment to a fundamental understanding of how the world works and translating that understanding into pragmatic, effective action *at the roots* for a wiser, weller society.

### 1. Tools & Infrastructure for Sensemaking

Creating the systems and technologies that support collective understanding — from data platforms to digital gardens. This work builds the foundations for wiser coordination, transparent knowledge flows, and participatory sensemaking in the information age.

### 2. Paradigmatic Change & a Second Renaissance

Exploring how worldviews evolve and how societies can consciously transition toward wiser, more compassionate ways of being. This includes inquiry into cultural evolution, inner development, systems change, and the conditions for a [second renaissance](https://secondrenaissance.net/) grounded in wisdom.

### 3. Information Policy & Knowledge Societies

Designing the principles, institutions, and policies for information commons and open knowledge societies. This builds on decades of work in open knowledge, data governance, and digital public goods.

### 4. Systemic Design & Social Innovation

Prototyping the architectures — organisational, institutional, and economic — that embody new paradigms in practice. This involves creating and supporting real-world experiments in regenerative living, governance, and collaboration.
