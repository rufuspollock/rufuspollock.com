### Dumping

Dumping is defined to be when a company exports a product at a price lower than the price it normally charges on its own home market.

'The WTO agreement does not pass judgement. Its focus is on how governments can or cannot react to dumping it disciplines anti-dumping actions, and it is often called the "Anti-Dumping Agreement".
. . . broadly speaking the WTO agreement allows governments to act against dumping where there is genuine ("material") injury to the competing domestic industry. In order to do that the government has to be able to show that dumping is taking place, calculate the extent of dumping (how much lower the export price is compared to the exporter’s home market price), and show that the dumping is causing injury.’
