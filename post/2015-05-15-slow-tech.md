A thought from a recent a recent [Digital Supper][ds]: just as there is "Slow Food" do we need a  "Slow Technology" movement - technology at a human pace.

A key difference is that this can't work just from individual action - though that will help - we would need coordinated action if tech were to evolve slower.
