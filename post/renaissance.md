5.5. Futuristic thriller noir set in 2054 Paris. Visually striking for being done entirely in chiroscuro animation using an innovative rendering to produce a result reminiscent of recent features such as Sin City. Unfortunately the plot and dialogue don't live up to the visuals which are without doubt stunning. 

[Aside: the producer claims that if the film were to have been shot 'for real' it have cost around $220 million instead of the $18 million. Does this point the way for future developments in the age of cheaper and cheaper IT infrastructure?]
