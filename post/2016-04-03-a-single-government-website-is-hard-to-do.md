> Examples of the steps ... President [Clinton] directed agencies to take include [in December **1999** memo]:
>
> 1. Create  **One-Stop  Access  for  Existing  Government  Information**. The  President  directed  the  Administrator of  the  General  Services  Administration,  in  conjunction  with  other government entities, to create a portal for government information, based “not by agency, but  by  the  type  of  service  or  information  that  people  may  be  seeking;  the  data  should  be  identified and  organized  in  a  way  that  makes  it  easier  for  the  public  to  find  the information  it  seeks.”    (In  June  2000,  President  Clinton  announced  that  firstgov.gov,  a free web site that will provide a single point of entry to all government on-line resources, would be created.  In September 2000, the site became operational.)

Interesting to note that that memo was written in 1999. A decade+ later governments would still be struggling to implement this recommendation. For exmaple, a single online access point for government information was a central recommendation in the Lane-Fox report on UK e-government in 2010 that would lead to the creation of the UK's GDS and the launch of a single online platform (gov.uk) in 2012.
