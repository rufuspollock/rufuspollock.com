As [announced on Friday on the UK Government's data.gov.uk](http://data.gov.uk/blog/new-public-sector-transparency-board-and-public-data-transparency-principles), I am one of the members of the UK Government's newly formed Public Sector Transparency Board.

From the announcement:

>The Public Sector Transparency Board, which was established by the Prime Minister, met yesterday for the first time.
>
>The Board will drive forward the Governmentâ€™s transparency agenda, making it a core part of all government business and ensuring that all Whitehall departments meet the new tight deadlines set for releasing key public datasets. In addition, it is responsible for setting open data standards across the whole public sector, listening to what the public wants and then driving through the opening up of the most needed data sets.
>
> Chaired by Francis Maude, the Minister for the Cabinet Office, the other members of the Transparency Board are Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, Professor Nigel Shadbolt from Southampton University, an expert on open data, Tom Steinberg, founder of mySociety, and Dr Rufus Pollock from Cambridge University, an economist who helped found the Open Knowledge Foundation.
>
> In the words of Francis Maude:
>
> â€œIn just a few weeks this Government has published a whole range of data sets that have never been available to the public before. But we donâ€™t want this to be about a few releases, we want transparency to become an absolutely core part of every bit of government business. That is why we have asked some of the countryâ€™s and the worldâ€™s greatest experts in this field to help us take this work forward quickly here in central government and across the whole of the public sector.â€
