This week I'm going to be in Amsterdam at [PICNIC '10][picnic] speaking about open data -- what it is, why it's good and how we can go about growing the open data ecosystem.

If you're in Amsterdam -- at PICNIC or otherwise -- and interested in open data do [get in touch][contact].

**Update: [slides have now been posted](http://m.okfn.org/files/talks/picnic10_open_data_20100924/) - enjoy!**
