For anyone with an interest in copyright issues, particularly in the online environment, there is an excellent event on today at the LSE organized by Ian Brown of the OII and at which I'll be speaking (briefly) on the subject of "How can we maximise copyright's return to society?" More details below.

### Musicians, fans and online copyright

This Wednesday afternoon we have a great selection of speakers for our free OII/LSE event on music and copyright.
