*Talk at the Open Tech Summit in Berlin on 5th of May 2016 [Backup of video on Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/MakingAnOpenInformationAgeOpenTechSummit2016)*

If you have ever been online, watched a movie or taken a medicine you have been a user of information. Today information in the form of software, databases and innovations is becoming more important than ever before. Information is becoming main thing we make, trade and use.

This is a new world being built on "bits". Its virtual nature makes it different from the physical world of bread and land and cars which can only have one user at a time. By contrast, information can be used by many at the same time. The implications of this are huge. It makes a world of open information both possible and desirable -- that is a world in which all public information can be openly and freely used, shared and built on.

This is a world where no-one is denied access to life-saving medicines because of cost, where everyone has access to our cultural heritage, where artists, innovators and creators are paid more and more fairly. But getting there will not be easy. Dystopia is the default: if we do nothing we will get a world of exclusion and control where information is made to play by the same rules as our old physical one using "intellectual property" monopoly rights like copyright and patents. In this talk we will explore the road ahead and explain why we can and must create an open future.

The talk is for anyone interested in the coming information age and its implications for the politics, law and economics of this next century.
