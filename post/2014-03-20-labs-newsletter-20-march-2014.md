<p>We’re back with a bumper crop of updates in this new edition of the now-monthly Labs newsletter!</p>

<h2 id="textus-viewer-refactoring">Textus Viewer refactoring</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/textus-viewer/">TEXTUS Viewer</a> is an HTML + JS application for viewing texts in the format of <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/projects/textus/">TEXTUS</a>, Labs’s open source platform for collaborating around collections of texts. The viewer has now been <a href="https://github.com/okfn/textus-viewer/issues/5">stripped down</a> to its bare essentials, becoming a leaner and more streamlined beast that’s easier to integrate into your projects.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/textus-viewer/">the demo</a> to see the new Viewer in action, and see the <a href="https://github.com/okfn/textus-viewer#usage">full usage instructions</a> in the repo.</p>

<h2 id="json-table-schema-foreign-key-support">JSON Table Schema: foreign key support</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://dataprotocols.org/json-table-schema/">JSON Table Schema</a>, Labs’s schema for tabular data, has just added an important new feature: support for <a href="http://dataprotocols.org/json-table-schema/#foreign-keys">foreign keys</a>. This means that the schema now provides a method for linking entries in a table to entries in a separate resource.</p>

<p>This update has been in the works for a long time, as you can see from <a href="https://github.com/dataprotocols/dataprotocols/issues/23">the discussion thread on GitHub</a>. Many thanks to everyone who participated in that year-long discussion, including <a href="http://trestletechnology.net/">Jeff Allen</a>, <a href="http://deadpansincerity.com/">David Miller</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gthb">Gunnlaugur Thor Briem</a>, <a href="http://standardanalytics.io/">Sebastien Ballesteros</a>, <a href="http://opennorth.ca/">James McKinney</a>, <a href="http://robotrebuilt.com/people/paulfitz/">Paul Fitzpatrick</a>, <a href="https://github.com/besquared">Josh Ferguson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tryggvib">Tryggvi Björgvinsson</a>, and <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/members/rgrp">Rufus Pollock</a>.</p>

<h2 id="renaming-of-data-explorer">Renaming of Data Explorer</h2>

<p><a href="http://okfnlabs.org/projects/data-explorer/">Data Explorer</a> is Labs’s in-browser data cleaning and visualization app—and it’s about to get a name change.</p>

<p>For the past four months, <a href="https://github.com/okfn/dataexplorer/issues/150">discussion around the new name</a> has been bubbling. As of right now, <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/members/rgrp">Rufus Pollock</a> is proposing to go with the new name <em>DataDeck</em>.</p>

<p>What do you think? If you object, now’s your chance to jump in the thread and re-open the issue!</p>

<h2 id="on-the-blog-sec-edgar-database">On the blog: SEC EDGAR database</h2>

<p>Rufus has been doing some work with the <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/blog/2014/03/04/sec-edgar-database.html">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) EDGAR database</a>, “a rich source of data containing regulatory filings from publicly-traded US corporations including their annual and quarterly reports”. He has written up his initial findings on the blog and created a <a href="https://github.com/datasets/edgar">repo</a> for the extracted data.</p>

<p>This is an interesting example of working with XBRL, the popular XML framework for financial reporting. You can find several good Python libraries for working with XBRL in <a href="https://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/okfn-labs/2014-March/001337.html">Rufus’s message to the mailing list</a>.</p>

<h2 id="labs-hangout-today">Labs Hangout: today!</h2>
