**Tomorrow we're holding the first [Open Shakespeare][] Annotation 'Sprint'.** We'll be getting together online and in-person to collaborate on critically annotating a complete Shakespeare play with all our work being [open][].

All of Shakespeare's texts are, of course, in the public domain, and therefore already ['open'][open]. However, most editions of Shakespeare people actually use (and purchase) are 'critical' editions, that is texts together with notes and annotations that explain or analyze the text, and, for these critical editions **no [open version][open] yet exists**. This weekend we're aiming to change that!

Using the [annotator tool][annotator] we now have a way to work collaboratively online to add and develop these 'critical' additions and the aim of the sprint is to **fully annotate one complete play**. Anyone can get involved, from lay-Shakespeare-lover to English professor, all you'll need is a web-browser and an interest in Bard, and even if you can't make it, you can [vote right now on which play we should work on][vote]!

Using ***specially-designed annotation software*** we intend to print an edition of Shakespeare unlike any other, incorporating glosses, textual notes and other information written by anyone able to connect to the [Open Shakespeare website][Open Shakespeare].
