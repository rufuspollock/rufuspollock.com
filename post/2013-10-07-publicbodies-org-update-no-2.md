<p>Herewith is a report on recent improvements to <a href="http://publicbodies.org/">PublicBodies.org</a>, our project in Open Knowledge Foundation Labs project to provide “a URL (and information) on every “public body” - that’s every government funded agency, department or organization.</p>

<h2 id="new-data">New data</h2>

<p>New data contributed over the last couple of months is now validated and live - this includes new data for <strong>Switzerland, Greece, Brazil and the US</strong>. Huge thank-you to contributors here including Hannes, Charalampos, Augusto and Todd.</p>

<p>We also have pending data for Italy and China to get in once it has been reviewed, and we have data in progress for Canada!</p>

<p>We’d love to have more data - if you’re interested in contributing see <a href="https://github.com/okfn/publicbodies#contribute-data">https://github.com/okfn/publicbodies#contribute-data</a></p>

<h2 id="updated-schema-for-data">Updated Schema for Data</h2>

<p>Thanks to input from James McKinney and others we’ve <a href="https://github.com/okfn/publicbodies/issues/29">reworked the schema</a> quite extensively to match up as much as possible with the Popolo spec. You can see the new schema in the <a href="https://github.com/okfn/publicbodies/blob/master/datapackage.json#L13-L105">datapackage.json</a>.</p>
