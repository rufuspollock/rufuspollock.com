Over Christmas I've had some spare time. This has permitted me to get the [Atlas of Economics Models][atlas] off the ground. This is a project I've been thinking about for some years, first motivated really by the experience of trying to discover what variations had been done on the basic Hotelling-line model of 'spatial' product differentiation and competition (previous allusion earlier in the Autumn [here](http://www.rufuspollock.org/2007/10/05/demand-theory-a-primer/)).

So what is the Atlas supposed to be? From the [front page][atlas]:

[atlas]:http://atlas.openeconomics.net

> The Atlas of Economic Models is a comprehensive list of the basic 'building-block' models used by economists. It also includes additional information, for example worked out analytical solutions to special cases and details as to how models inter-relate (hence the 'Atlas' in the title). More about the atlas can be found on the about page [about page](http://atlas.openeconomics.net/about/).

Other important features of the Atlas are that it is:

  * Community Editable: the Atlas is a community-based project with most content editable by anyone who wishes to contribute. Specifically we're managing the content in a wiki and to edit any given page all you need to do is click on the edit button at the bottom of that page. 
  * Openly Licensed: all content is [openly licensed](http://opendefinition.org/). That is all material is made available under a license that permits it to be freely used, reused, shared and redistributed by others. Further details on the [license page](http://atlas.openeconomics.net/license).

As yet, it obviously does not have much content but that should be gradually remedied over the coming months. And if you're economically inclined why not head over there and help out ...
