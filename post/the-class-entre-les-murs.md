5/10. Very so-so. Starts with some promise but one's attention is wandering heavily even before the half-way point and the rather contrived climax centred on a pupil's expulsion does little to bring it back. Having seen it I am baffled by the acclaim this film has received, it even won the Palme D'Or -- perhaps it something to do with the film's "worthy" subject matter.
