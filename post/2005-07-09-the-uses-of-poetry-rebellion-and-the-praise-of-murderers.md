I was struck by this comment of Charles Simic in a review of Pablo Neruda's poems [NYR Sept 25 2003 p.43]: <strong><q>Rebellion may be one of poetry's traditions, but so is eulogizing the goodwill and godlike wisdom of some murderer</q></strong>.

The context for this comment was Simic's discussion of Neruda's devout Communism which resulted in the penning of lines such as:

In three rooms of the old Kremlin
<br />
lives a man named Joseph Stalin
<br />
His bedroom light is turned off late.
<br />
The world and his country allow him no rest
