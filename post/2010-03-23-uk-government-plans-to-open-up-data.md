Yesterday, in a speech on ["Building Britainâ€™s Digital Future"](http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page22897), UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced wide-ranging plans to open up UK government data. In addition to a general promise to extend the existing commitments to "make public data public" the PM announced:

  * The opening up of a large and important set of transport data (the [NaPTAN dataset](http://ckan.net/package/naptan))
  * A commitment to open up a significant amount of Ordnance Survey data from the 1st April (though details of which datasets not yet specified)
  * By the Autumn an online e-"domesday" book giving "an inventory of all non-personal datasets held by departments and arms-length bodies
  * A new "institute" for web science headed by Tim Berners-Lee and Nigel Shadbolt and with an initial Â£30m in funding

This speech is a significant indication of a further commitment to the "making public data public" policy announced in the Autumn.

It's great to see this as, a year ago it seemed as if government policy was [set to largely ignore](http://www.rufuspollock.org/2009/04/23/results-of-the-trading-funds-review/) the research in the [Models of Public Sector Information Provision by Trading Funds report](http://www.rufuspollock.org/2008/03/12/models-of-public-sector-information-provision-via-trading-funds-report-published-today/) (authored by myself, David Newbery and Professor Bently back in 2008) whose basic conclusions was that that government data which was digital, bulk and 'upstream' should be made available at marginal cost.


### More detailed excerpts (with emphasis added)

#### Opening up data

> In January we launched data.gov.uk, a single, easy-to-use website to access public data. And even in the short space of time since then, the interest this initiative has attracted - globally - has been very striking. The site already has more than three thousand data sets available - and more are being added all the time. And in the past month the Office for National Statistics has opened up access for web developers to over two billion data items right down to local neighbourhood level.
>
> The Department for Transport and the transport industry are **today making available the core reference datasets that contain the precise names and co-ordinates of all 350 thousand bus stops, railway stations and airports in Britain.**
>
> Public transport timetables and real-time running information is currently owned by the operating companies. But we will work to free it up - and from today we will make it a condition of future franchises that this data will be made freely available.
>
> And following the strong support in our recent consultation, I can confirm that from **1st April, we will be making a substantial package of information held by ordnance survey** ***freely available to the public, without restrictions on re-use***. Further details on the package and governmentâ€™s response to the consultation will be published by the end of March.

#### e-Domesday Book

> And I can also tell you today that in the autumn the Government will **publish online an inventory of all non-personal datasets held by departments and arms-length bodies - a â€œdomesday bookâ€ for the 21st century.**
>
> The programme will be managed by the National Archives and it will be overseen by a new open data board which will report on the first edition of the new domesday book by April next year. The Government will then produce its detailed proposals including how this work can be extended to the wider public sector.
>
> To inform the continuing development of making public data public, the National Archives will produce a consultation paper on a definition of the â€œpublic taskâ€ for public data, to be published later this year.
>
> The new domesday book will for the first time allow the public to access in one place **information on each set of data including its size, source, format, content, timeliness, cost and quality.** And there will be an expectation that departments will release each of these datasets, or account publicly for why they are not doing so.
>
> Any business or individual will be **free to embed this public data in their own websites, and to use it in creative ways within their own applications.**

#### Mygov

> ...
> 
> So our goal is to replace this first generation of e-government with a much more interactive second generation form of digital engagement which we are calling Mygov.
>
> Companies that use technology to interact with their users are positioning themselves for the future, and government must do likewise.  Mygov marks the end of the one-size-fits-all, man-from-the-ministry-knows-best approach to public services.
>
> Mygov will constitute a radical new model for how public services will be delivered and for how citizens engage with government - making interaction with government as easy as internet banking or online shopping. This open, personalised platform will allow us to deliver universal services that are also tailored to the needs of each individual; to move from top-down, monolithic websites broadcasting public service information in the hope that the people who need help will find it - to government on demand.
>
> And rather than civil servants being the sole authors and editors, we will unleash data and content to the community to turn into applications that meet genuine needs. **This does not require large-scale government IT Infrastructure; the â€˜open sourceâ€™ technology that will make it happen is freely available. All that is required is the will and willingness of the centre to give up control.**
