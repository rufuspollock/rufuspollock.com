In September 2017, I went to World Economic Forum (WEF) HQ to talk about the ideas for an "Open World" where all non-personal digital information would be open -- and innovators would be recognized and rewarded. (These are the ideas in my upcoming book the Open Revolution).

For WEF I focused on the connections between the 4th Industrial Revolution and the an open information economy. Here are the slideas for that meeting.
