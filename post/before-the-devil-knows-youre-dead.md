6/10. This latest outing from Sidney Lumet is an unusual combination of family melodrama and crime-gone-wrong Greek tragedy. Unfortunately, though ticking all the boxes (acting, script etc) it left one rather cold, largely due to the absence of any character who merited the audience's sympathy. After all, for tragedy to work must care about the character whom it befalls -- even if their downfall is principally the result of their own actions or their own failings.
