This week I'm in Budapest for the EEA/ESEM annual congress. I'll be presenting [Cumulative Innovation, Sampling and the Hold-Up Problem](http://rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/holdup_and_sampling.pdf) in the ESEM stream on Friday afternoon in the 1500-1700 slot. I'll gradually post further notes as I write them over the week.
