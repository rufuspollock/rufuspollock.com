> ## What is Eurostat?

> Eurostat is the largest source of statistical information about European member states. It contains detailed comparative information on everything from tonnes of fish caught per year to the length of our railway lines, from how much energy we consume to how happy we are.

> ## What is the Eurostat Hackday?

> On the 16th December 2010 a bunch of independent coders, designers and other interested parties in a number of different European cities will gather to brainstorm and build useful and interesting things using the Eurostat data.

> ## How can I join in?

> If you're interested in joining in, please [add your name, affiliation and location to the Etherpad](http://opengovernmentdata.okfnpad.org/eurostat-hackday) and come and say hello on our [euopendata mailing list](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/euopendata).
