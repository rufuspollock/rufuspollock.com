As part of my Shuttleworth Fellowship I'm preparing bi-annual reviews of what I -- and projects I'm involved in -- have been up to. So, herewith are some some highlights from the last 6 months.

## CKAN and the theDataHub

  * Finalized separation of software and site: [CKAN][] = data hub software, [theDataHub.org][datahub] = community data hub site
  * Worked heavily to develop CKAN as a product e.g. much improved website http://ckan.org/, nascent partner programme and more
  * Major milestone with [CKAN v1.5 release][ckan-v1.5] just 2 weeks ago. Result of 6 months of development with major new features.
  * [theDataHub][datahub] has also been much improved with move to new servers, a new theme (default in CKAN v1.5) and deployment of ever more extensions
  * Some personal items:
    * [DataExplorer][]
    * UX work - http://wiki.ckan.org/UX
    * [data package manager (dpm)][dpm] and work on [Data Packages spec][data-packages]

[ckan-v1.5]: http://blog.okfn.org/2011/11/14/major-new-ckan-release-v1-5/

## OpenSpending

  * Two major point releases of [OpenSpending software][os-repo] [v0.10][os-v0.10] and [v0.11][os-v0.11] (v0.11 just last week!). Huge maturing and development of the system. Backend architecture now finalized after a major refactor and reworking.
  * Community has grown significantly with now almost 50 OpenSpending datasets on theDataHub.org and growing group of core "data wranglers"
  * [Spending Stories][spending-stories] was a winner of the Knight News Challenge. Spending Stories will build on and extend OpenSpending.

## Open Bibliography and the Public Domain

  * The [Public Domain Review][pdr] goes from strength to strength
  * [BibServer][] has had a ground-up rewrite and can be seen online at http://bibsoup.net/
  * Additional support from JISC for a second phase of [JISC Open Bibliography project](http://openbiblio.net/p/jiscopenbib2/)

## Open Knowledge Foundation and the Community

  * In September we received a 3 year [grant from the Omidyar Network to help the Open Knowledge Foundation sustain and expand its community][omidyar-grant] especially in the formation of new chapters
  * Completed a [major recruitment process][jobs] in (Summer-Autumn 2011) to bring on more paid OKFN team members including community coordinators, foundation coordinator and developers
  * The Foundation participated in launch of Open Government Partnership and CSO events surrounding the meeting
  * [Working groups][okfn-wg] continuing to develop. Too much activity to summarize it all here but some highlights include:
    * WG Science Coordinator Jenny Molloy travelling to OSS2011 in SF to present Open Research Reports with Peter Murray-Rust
    * Open Economics WG developing and Open Knowledge Index in August
    * Open Bibliography working group's work on an Metadata guide.
    * Open Humanities / Open Literature working group winning Inventare Il Futuro competition with their idea to use the [Annotator][]
  * Development of new [Local Groups and Chapters][chapters]
    * Lots of ongoing activities in existing local groups and chapters such as those in Germany and Italy have
    * In addition, interest from a variety of areas in the establishment of new chapters and local groups, for example in [Brazil][chapter-brazil] and [Belgium][chapter-belgium]
  * Start of work on [OKFN labs][labs]
    * Alpha website at http://labs.okfn.org/
    * [Dashboard sprint][dashboard]
