5.5/10. While boasting a phenomenal visual imagination clearly bearing the signature of the film's Director Dave McKean the film as a whole was distinctly lacking in oomph. The plot always remains a little too fanciful and the lack of coherent development with constant jarring jolts with many scenes simply petering out to be hurriedly replaced via yet another coincidence (flimsily justified by an <q>it's all a dream</q> backstory) give one the sense this is a film (and story) that exists to serve its visual ideas rather than the other way round. Definitely a case of lots of wonderful ideas (and even dialogue) poorly woven together into a coherent whole.
