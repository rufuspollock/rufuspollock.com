As is the way with Academic Journals nearly 3 years after the original version (and two after the revised one) the Oberholzer and Strumpf study (see [my summary of the p2p literature for details](http://www.rufuspollock.org/economics/p2p_summary.html)) is now [out in the JPE](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/resolve?JPE31618PDF).
