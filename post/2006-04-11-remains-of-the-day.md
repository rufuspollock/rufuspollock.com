7/10. A classic Merchant-Ivory production, intelligent, very well acted and beautifully shot. However while the tragedy of Stephens, whose dedication to the role of the perfect butler has led him to extinguish all emotion, and even, it appears, the ability to apprehend the events around him, is a moving one, its very basis -- in the inability to of Stephens to feel and act -- removed me from it and thereby greatly reduced its power.
