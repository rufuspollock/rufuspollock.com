*Openness is transforming our societies and economies.*

*Join the Open Leaders program to learn about the key ideas and developments in this rapidly growing space.*

### About the program

* Where: Lapinlahdenkatu 16, 00101 Helsinki, Finland
* When: 10 September 2017, 10:30am to 6:30pm
* Cost: 0-100 euros (you pay what you can)
* Language: English

In the program you will discover openness as one of the most important policy opportunities of the twenty-first century. An issue that connects not only to innovation but broader social concerns such as healthcare, inequality, AI and the future of work. This is an opportunity to go beyond your everyday work and get a glimpse of the road ahead in this exciting area.

Find out how you can take on leadership and make a difference whether in your community, in your business, or in your government.

The next Open Leaders workshop takes place in Helsinki on Sunday 10 September 2017.

This special event has a limited number of places. Apply [here](http://open-leaders.com/helsinki-sep-2017/).
