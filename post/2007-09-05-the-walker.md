7/10. A well-above average work largely thanks to the excellent dialogue and acting (the central performance from Harrelson is particularly good). Unfortunately the film fails to fully deliver on its noirish thriller potential -- fading out just the excitement starts to build and leaving the political corruption side of things sadly underexplored. With a larger budget and more work on the final third this could well have been something outstanding, comparable with the likes of Chinatown.
