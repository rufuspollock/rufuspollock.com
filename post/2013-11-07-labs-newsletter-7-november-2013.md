<p>There was lots of interesting activity around Labs this week, with two launched projects, a new initiative in the works, and an Open Data Maker Night in London.</p>

<h2 id="webshot-online-screenshot-service">Webshot: online screenshot service</h2>

<p><a href="http://webshot.okfnlabs.org/">webshot.okfnlabs.org</a>, an online service for taking screenshots of websites, is now live, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/opsb">Oliver Searle-Barnes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simong">Simon Gaeremynck</a>.</p>

<p>Try it out with an API call like this:</p>

<pre><code>http://webshot.okfnlabs.org/?url=http://okfnlabs.org&amp;width=640&amp;height=480
</code></pre>

<p>Read more about the development behind the service <a href="https://github.com/okfn/ideas/issues/63">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="product-open-data-android-app">Product Open Data Android app</h2>

<p>The first version of the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.okfn.pod">Android app</a> for <a href="http://www.product-open-data.com/">Product Open Data</a> has launched, allowing you to conveniently look up open data associated with a product on your phone.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/okfn/product-browser-android">source code</a> for the app is available on GitHub.</p>

<h2 id="crowdcrafting-for-public-bodies">Crowdcrafting for Public Bodies</h2>

<p><a href="http://publicbodies.org/">PublicBodies.org</a> aims to provide “a URL for every part of government”. Many entries in the database lack good description text, though, making them harder to use effectively. Fixing this would be <a href="http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/okfn-labs/2013-October/001117.html">a good use of CrowdCrafting.org</a>, the crowd-sourcing platform powered by <a href="http://dev.pybossa.com/">PyBossa</a>.</p>

<p>Rufus suggests this start small and begin with EU public bodies. It should be <a href="http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/okfn-labs/2013-October/001120.html">easy to build a CrowdCrafting app</a> to cover those, says Daniel Lombraña González. Friedrich Lindenberg thinks this approach <a href="http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/okfn-labs/2013-November/001125.html">could work for other datasets</a> as well.</p>

<p>Discussion of this idea is still happening on the list, so jump in and say what you think—or help build the app!</p>

<h2 id="open-data-maker-night-6">Open Data Maker Night #6</h2>

<p>The sixth <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/events/open-data-maker/">Open Data Maker Night</a> took place this past Tuesday in London. Open Data Maker Nights are informal events where people make things with open data, whether apps or insights.</p>

<p>This night’s focus was on adding more UK and London data to <a href="http://openspending.org/">OpenSpending</a>, and it featured special guest <a href="http://maxogden.com/">Max Ogden</a>. It was hosted by the Centre for Creative Collaboration.</p>

<p>Our next Open Data Maker Night will happen in early December. If you want to organize your own, though, it’s super easy: just see the <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/events/open-data-maker/">Open Data Maker Night website</a> for help booting, promoting, and running the event.</p>
