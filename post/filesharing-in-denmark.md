[Lessig](http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/003460.shtml) reports on some work done by [Claus Pedersen](http://www.piratgruppen.org/) on filesharing in Denmark. Unfortunately the full paper is in danish but a summary has been translated by Marie Elisabeth Pade and is available at http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/danish_filesharing.pdf.
