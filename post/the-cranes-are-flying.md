8.5/10 (2006-01-31). Great Russian tearjerker about a young man (Boris) and woman (Veronica) seperated during the great patriotic war (WWII). Two amazing collage sequences one as Boris dies and visions of the birch trees above him mix with those of his hoped for wedding the second as Veronica rushes to the railway bridge to commit suicide.
