About a week ago I finally got around to converting from .doc to html some of my more substantial essays from my schooldays. They're up at http://www.rufuspollock.org/nonfiction/ and you can find more or less substantial pieces on the Vietnam War, the decline of the Liberal Party in Great Britain in the early 20th century, the school as institution, Italy in the late 19th century and Fellini's *La Dolce Vita*.
