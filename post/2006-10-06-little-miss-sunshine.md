8.5/10. A wonderful film, moving, funny and involving. Finely observed performances, particularly from Kinnear and Collette (especially), do full justice to a beautifully crafted plot and script. While the feel-good ending is never in doubt, we are spared any descent into saccharinaity -- something which often mars Hollywood forays into similar territory -- and when the credits finally do roll they arrive neither too soon nor too late.
