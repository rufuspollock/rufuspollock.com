Today I attended the first day of a two-day [workshop](http://www.robinson.cam.ac.uk/academic/lectures.php) ([programme](http://www.robinson.cam.ac.uk/academic/robinson_rationality_programme.pdf)) on *Rationality and Emotions* organized by Miriam Teschl at Robinson College here at Cambridge. The mix of economics, psychology and neuroscience has so far been fascinating and below I include some general 'impressionistic' notes from some of the sessions so far.

### Stress and Euphoria on a Trading Floor by John Coates

#### Overview

  * Better title might have been 'Fear and Greed'.
  * Managed a trading desk on Wall Street.
  * Are fear and greed exaggerated by a steroid induced shift in risk preferences?
  * Cortisol rises in a market crash, raises risk aversion and accentuates crash.
  * Little literature on hormones
    * one paper on oxycytocin and trust
  * Steroids have very widespread effects in body (everything from body shape to cognitive function).
  * Cortisol follows adrenalin as a stress response.
    * Acute exposure: euphorogenic, increases motivation (+ve basically)
    * Chronic exposure: bad. Selective attention to negative precedents (Erikson 2003) etc.
      * Decrease risk preferences
  * Traders
    * 17 males, 19-38 from City Trading Floor. Healthy and no outside source of stress.
    * No overnight positions, no salary, no bonus. Just given capital and trade (each with own deal: basically a percentage or profits)
    * Annual P&L range: -10k to +5m
    * Experiment was live because you could not replicate high stakes trading in the lab.
    * Trading US Bond Futures adn Bund Future, Dax, and Euro/$
    * German market main component of P+L so that was the focus
    * Use calendar of econ stat announcements as 'stress' events (some traders make almost all their money just when US employment info comes out)
  * Data:
    * Sampled 2x a day (11am,, 4pm) to bracket NY 0830 news releases
    * P+L at 11am and 4pm
    * Long term P+L
    * Plus other info

#### Results

  * Massive volatility in cortisol: cortisol should drop by 30% in a normal subjects but in 40% of subjects upwards slopes were increasing by 500%
  * No relation of cortisol to P+L at all (surprising: but this was not a a very volatile period).
  * But a strong relation of cortisol and std dev of P+L 
  * Next look at effect of expected volatility (measured by implied volatility measures used to price derivatives) to see whether this affects cortisol release
    * incredibly good fit (people were excited because volatility means there is money to be made)
  * Conclusion: only saw acute exposure effects (so mainly excitement)
    * prolonged exposure could be very different: 'irrational pessimism' (but no evidence in this paper)

### The Psychology of Gambling Behaviour by Dr Luke Clark

#### Overview

  * Lots of Gambling and it has been increasing (9.6bn a year)
  * Structural characteristics lead to overestimation chances of winning
    * Erroneous verbalizations using 'think aloud' (Gaboury and Ladouceur 1988) -- up to 80% of their thoughts are irrational (problem gamblers show more)
    * Gamblers develop 'illusion of control' (Langer 1975)
    * Failure appreciate independence of turns (Wagenaar)
  * Investigate particular items
    * Effect of 'near-misses': people play more when more near-misses (Kassinove and Scharre 2001 find maximum at 30% of near-misses)
    * Effect of personal control:
      * craps: people bet more on their own throw than on others' throws
      * roulette: higher bets when palyer versus croupier throws ball
      * lottery: players demand more to exchange self-selected tickets ($9) than lucky dip tickets ($2) (Langer 1975)
  * Experimental design like a slot/fruit machine (but with participant having chance to select value on left 'wheel')
    * Thus can investigate both control and near-misses at same time
    * Also elicit feeling at particular points of time

#### Results
  
  * Behaviour
    * control results in significant increase in 'happiness with situation'
    * happier when they win if 'in control'
    * interaction of control and near-miss: when in control near-miss increases desire to continue (but this is not so when computer 'in control')
  * Arousal:
    * near-miss impact on arousal depends on control (w/o control no response)
  * fMRI
    * participants who show more erroneous beliefs in questionnaire show more activity in response to near-misses

#### Summary

  * Gambling-related cognitive distortions can be elicited on a laboratory task
  * Personal control increased perceived chance of winning and pleasure at winning
  * Near-misses are aversive but encourage continued play (*when player 'in control')


### Time and Emotions by Stephane Luchini

#### Overview

  * People prefer to 'consume' something unpleasant before something 'pleasant' (if they have a choice)
    * seems problematic as with discounting would expect the opposite
  * One explanation: people 'consume' an event both at the time it happens and before (thus want the good thing second so you 'anticipate' it for longer).
  * But what about the effect of the anticipated outcome on the *subjective* experience of time
    * Significant amount of evidence that emotions affect time perception
  * Emotions are generated by differential/passage between two situations (not time dependent)
  * Anticipated duration is function of actual clock time and the basic emotion which depends on difference between current state and future state.

#### Results

  * To obtain time reversal (negative time preference) emotions must have strong impact on time discounting
  * Only can occur if the the future date is not too remote.
