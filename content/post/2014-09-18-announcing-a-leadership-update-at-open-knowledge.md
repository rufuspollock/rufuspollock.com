<p>Today I would like to share some important organisational news. After 3 years with Open Knowledge, Laura James, our CEO, has decided to move on to new challenges. As a result of this change we will be seeking to recruit a new senior executive to lead Open Knowledge as it continues to evolve and grow.</p>

<p><img src="http://assets.okfn.org/p/okfn/img/okfn-logo-landscape.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As many of you know, Laura James joined us to support the organisation as we scaled up, and stepped up to the CEO role in 2013. It has always been her intention to return to her roots in engineering at an appropriate juncture, and we have been fortunate to have had Laura with us for so long  &#8211; she will be sorely missed.</p>

<p>Laura has made an immense contribution and we have been privileged to have her on board &#8211; I&#8217;d like to extend my deep personal thanks to her for all she has done. Laura has played a central role in our evolution as we&#8217;ve grown from a team of half-a-dozen to more than forty. Thanks to her commitment and skill we&#8217;ve navigated many of the tough challenges that accompany &#8220;growing-up&#8221; as an organisation.</p>

<p>There will be no change in my role (as President and founder) and I will be here both to continue to help lead the organisation and to work closely with the new appointment going forward. Laura will remain in post, continuing to manage and lead the organisation, assisting with the recruitment and bringing the new senior executive on board.</p>

<p>For a decade, Open Knowledge has been a leader in its field, working at the forefront of efforts to open up information around the world and and see it used to empower citizens and organisations to drive change. Both the community and original non-profit have grown &#8211; and continue to grow &#8211; very rapidly, and the space in which we work continues to develop at an incredible pace with many exciting new opportunities and activities.</p>

<p>We have a fantastic future ahead of us and I&#8217;m very excited as we prepare Open Knowledge to make its next decade even more successful than its first.</p>

<p>We will keep everyone informed in the coming weeks as our plans develop, and there will also be opportunities for the Open Knowledge community to  discuss. In the meantime, please donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch with me if you have any questions.</p>
