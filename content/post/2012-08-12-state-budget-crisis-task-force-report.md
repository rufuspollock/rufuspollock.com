The [State Budget Crisis Task Force](http://www.statebudgetcrisis.org/) was convened in June 2011 and issued its report in July 2012.

The top line quote from the main site states:

> State finances are **not transparent** and often include **hidden liabilities** as well as rapidly growing responsibilities which are difficult to control.  While state **revenues** are gradually recovering from the drastic decline of the Great Recession, they are **not growing sufficiently to keep pace with the spending required** by Medicaid costs, pensions, and other responsibilities and obligations.  This has resulted in **persistent and growing structural deficits** in many states which threaten their fiscal sustainability. [emphasis added]
