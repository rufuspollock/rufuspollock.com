4.5/10. Dull and disappointing largely as a result of the basic story. Curtis' impulsive decision to get married is just so obviously foolish (even more so the decision to have a child) and his endless soul-searching about it later just elicits a strong feeling of a) get over it b) I told you so. His final decision to commit suicide seemed both random (ok, so he's got worries but they aren't overwhelming) and unnecessary. Obviously this may be what life is like but we don't choose to turn most people's lives into films -- art, after all, is about selection, even when attempting to convey the quotidien.
