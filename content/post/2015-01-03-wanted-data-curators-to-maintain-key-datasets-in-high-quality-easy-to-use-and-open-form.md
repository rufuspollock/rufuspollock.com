<p>Wanted: volunteers to join a team of “Data Curators” maintaining <strong>“core” datasets</strong> (like GDP or ISO-codes) in <strong>high-quality, easy-to-use and open</strong> form.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>What is the project about</strong>: Collecting and maintaining important and commonly-used (“core”) datasets in high-quality, standardized and easy-to-use form - in particular, as up-to-date, well-structured <a href="http://data.okfn.org/doc/data-package/">Data Packages</a>.<br />
The “Core Datasets” effort is part of the broader <a href="http://data.okfn.org/">Frictionless Data initiative</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>What would you be doing</strong>: identifying and locating core (public) datasets, cleaning and standardizing the data and making sure the results are kept up to date and easy to use</li>
  <li><strong>Who can participate</strong>: anyone can contribute. Details on the skills needed are below.</li>
  <li><strong>Get involved</strong>: read more below or jump straight to <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/blog/2015/01/03/data-curators-wanted-for-core-datasets.html#sign-up">the sign-up section</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-the-core-datasets-effort">What is the Core Datasets effort?</h2>

<p>Summary: Collect and maintain important and commonly-used (“core”) datasets in high-quality, reliable and easy-to-use form (as Data Packages).</p>

<p>Core = important and commonly-used datasets e.g. reference data (country codes) and indicators (inflation, GDP)</p>

<p>Curate = take existing data and provide it in high-quality, reliable, and easy-to-use form (standardized, structured, open)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Full details</strong>: including slide-deck at <a href="http://data.okfn.org/roadmap/core-datasets">http://data.okfn.org/roadmap/core-datasets</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Live examples</strong>: You can find already packaged core datasets at <a href="http://data.okfn.org/data/">http://data.okfn.org/data/</a> and in “raw” form on Github at <a href="https://github.com/datasets/">https://github.com/datasets/</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-roles-and-skills-are-needed">What Roles and Skills are Needed</h2>

<p>We need a variety of roles from identifying new “core” datasets to packaging the data to performing quality control (checking metadata etc).</p>

<p><strong>Core Skills</strong> - at least one of these skills will be needed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Wrangling Experience</strong>. Many of our source datasets are not complex (just an Excel file or similar) and can be “wrangled” in a Spreadsheet program. What we therefore recommend is at least one of:
    <ul>
      <li>Experience with a Spreadsheet application such as Excel or (preferably) Google Docs including use of formulas and (desirably) macros (you should at least know how you could quickly convert a cell containing ‘2014’ to ‘2014-01-01’ across 1000 rows)</li>
      <li>Coding for data processing (especially scraping) in one or more of python, javascript, bash</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Data sleuthing</strong> - the ability to dig up data on the web (specific desirable skills: you know how to search by filetype in google, you know where the developer tools are in chrome or firefox, you know how to find the URL a form posts to)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Desirable Skills</strong> (the more the better!):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data vs Metadata: know difference between data and metadata</li>
  <li>Familiarity with Git (and Github)</li>
  <li>Familiarity with a command line (preferably bash)</li>
  <li>Know what JSON is</li>
  <li>Mac or Unix is your default operating system (will make access to relevant tools that much easier)</li>
  <li>Knowledge of Web APIs and/or HTML</li>
  <li>Use of curl or similar command line tool for accessing Web APIs or web pages</li>
  <li>Scraping using a command line tool or (even better) by coding yourself</li>
  <li>Know what a Data Package and a Tabular Data Package are</li>
  <li>Know what a text editor is (e.g. notepad, textmate, vim, emacs, …) and know how to use it (useful for both working with data and for editing Data Package metadata)</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="sign-up" id="sign-up"></a></p>

<h2 id="get-involved---sign-up-now">Get Involved - Sign Up Now!</h2>

<p>We are looking for volunteer contributors to form a “curation team”.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Time commitment</strong>: Members of the team commit to at least 8-16h per month (though this will be an average - if you are especially busy with other things one month and do less that is fine)</li>
  <li><strong>Schedule</strong>: There is no schedule so you can contribute at any time that is good for you - evenings, weekeneds, lunch-times etc</li>
  <li><strong>Location</strong>: all activity will be carried out online so you can be based anywhere in the world</li>
  <li><strong>Skills</strong>: see above</li>
</ul>

<p>To register your interest fill in the following form. Any questions, please <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/contact/">get in touch directly</a>.</p>

<h3 id="want-to-dive-straight-in">Want to Dive Straight In?</h3>

<p>Can’t wait to get started as a Data Curator? You can dive straight in and start packaging the already-selected (but not packaged) core datasets. Full instructions here:</p>
