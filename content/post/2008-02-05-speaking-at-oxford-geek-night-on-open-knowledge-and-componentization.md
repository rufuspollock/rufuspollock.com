Tomorrow I'll be speaking with Nate Olson at the [latest Oxford Geek Night](http://oxford.geeknights.net/2008/feb-6th/) on the subject of *Open Knowledge and Componentization*. Here's the blurb:

> Componentization on a large scale (such as in the Debian â€˜aptâ€™ packaging system) has allowed large software projects to be amazingly productive through their use of a decentralised, collaborative, incremental development process. Componentization works so well because it allows us to â€˜divide and conquerâ€™ the organizational and conceptual problems of highly complex systems. Given this, what are the possibilities (and problems) of this approach for knowledge generally? How do we best design "knowledge APIs", discover and distribute existing resources, and recombine decentralised datasets? In this talk we'll discuss the answers to (some of) these questions focusing particularly on the role the [Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network](http://www.ckan.net/) can play.

So, if you're in the Oxford vicinity and interested in Open Knowledge and related matters (there's a good line-up of other speakers including Denise Wilton of moo.com) why not drop in to the Jericho Tavern around 7.30pm tomorrow evening.
