A bit of playing around with the excellent [bibtex2html](http://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/bibtex2html/) and my bibtex economics bibliography is now up online in html format:

<http://www.rufuspollock.org/economics/biblio/>

It has a fairly good coverage of published material in the areas of IP and innovation, though by no means complete, particularly on the working papers front as I don't tend to enter these unless I'm specifically citing them in a paper.
