I've just put up a revised version of an <a href="/economics/papers/defaults_for_ip_policy.html">essay on IP policy</a> I've had sitting around on the hard drive for a while.

Its main argument is that an evidence-based approach for IP doesn't have much bite unless it is accompanied by an explicit statement of the defaults (i.e. what your priors are before considering the evidence).
