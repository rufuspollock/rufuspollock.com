It took 12 years to produce (1988-2000) and cost 4.5 million dollars (according to its editor Richard Talbert). It has a whole page dedicated to listing donors and supporters of the project. It recruited seventy-three compilers, with ten regional editors with ninety-five reviewers and twenty-two cartographers.

It is 148 pp. long and with companion gazetteer comes in at $350.00 (if you take the gazetteer on paper -- 1,383 pp. -- it comes down to $150.00). This implies a unit price to fixed cost ratio of 1 to 10,000.
