*Written on a train, some years ago*

The tail-end of dusk,  
Its softness making beauty of the world

The distant horizon pinked up in pastels  
Beckons to eternity

While leftward lies darkness  
Gathering all to her endless embrace.

The trees now shorn to subtlety  
Are framed against the remnants of the sky

Trees, hedges, houses  
All are soft shadows of themselves

And even a car-park sheathed in raucous lights  
Can not offend.

The hemisphere runs in colours  
Tuned to some resonance within

That calls out to savannah's long ago  
Beauty is leaving us and -

I cannot, cannot hold this,  
Cannot make enough of my mind space

To seize this fleeting figure of the world  
And make it fast.
