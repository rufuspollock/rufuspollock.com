4/10. Abysmal and travesty of previous outings. The plotting was so casual as to be insulting, compared to previous outings the set-pieces were very weak, and the reintroduction of Marion (by the most creaky of plot devices) only served to emphasize how far from the original this had fallen (and how dependent on derivative recycling this was). I doubted that Lucas's (responsible for the story) reputation could fall much further after the debacle of the Star Wars prequels but I was wrong.
