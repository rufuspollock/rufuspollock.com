7/10. Beautifully shot, intelligently scripted and well-acted this was a revisionist western where shootings, including that of James himself, were in the back and outlaws aren't romantic heroes but  incompetent psychopaths living out dull existences while the law, betrayal or poverty slowly catches up with them.
