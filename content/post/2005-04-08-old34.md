<ol>
  <li>
    Uncodified knowledge cannot be transferred except by f2f interaction (apprenticeship etc)
  </li>
  <li>
    But knowledge codification is very time and space consuming (and much still remains implicit)
  </li>
  <li>
    As the amount of codified knowledge grows it becomes harder to find what you want
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  <strong>Hypothesis: Value of Information in Databank = Value of Information if it could be Accessed Perfectly x Ease of Finding Any Particular Item</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Plausible to assume Ease of Finding Information = h(Amount) where h' less than 0
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Let Amount = n
  </li>
	<li>
    In standard Computer Science if we could sort items in some manner (by which we could also search). h(N) = log(n) (and sorting costs are n log(n) - bubble sort)
  </li>
	<li>
    Suppose only option is brute comparison (and it is useful to find a negative i.e. that what you want isn't in there). Then this suggests E(search time) = n/2 and h(n) = 2/n
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Plausible to have diminishing return for Value of Information if it could be Accessed Perfectly = f(Amount). So f'' less than 0. Thus f grows at less than linear rate (eventually ...). 	* If h has form suggested i.e. 2/n then we would have eventually Value of Information Bank is /decreasing/ in amount of information in databank
