Yesterday I went along to hear Tim Hubbard speak at the Cambridge University Pugwash Society on *New economic models for biomedical R&D to address the worldwide problem of access to medicines*. Tim's an excellent presenter and this talk did a great job of explaining a complex issue to an unfamiliar audience (I remember my [own talk over a year ago there on similar topics ago](http://blog.okfn.org/2005/10/25/talk-tonight-to-cambridge-university-pugwash-society/). Tim mainly focused on explaining the benefits of something like the [Medical Innovation Convention](http://blog.okfn.org/2004/10/30/the-medical-innovation-convention-a-new-global-framework-for-healthcare-research-and-development/) -- a global treaty for medical R&D that was developed by Tim and Jamie Love and is now part of the wider [access to knowledge (a2k)](http://www.access2knowledge.org/cs/) agenda.
