<h2 id="what-is-it-about">What Is It About?</h2>

<h3 id="building-community">Building Community</h3>

<p>We want to bring together data makers/doers/hackers from backgrounds like
science, journalism, open government and the wider software industry to share
tools and stories.</p>

<h3 id="for-those-who-love-data">For those who love data</h3>

<p>CSV Conf is a non-profit community conference run by some folks who really love
data and sharing knowledge. If you are as passionate about data and the
application it has to society then you should join us!</p>

<h3 id="big-and-small">Big and small</h3>

<p>This isn’t a conference just about spreadsheets. We are curating content about
advancing the art of data collaboration, from putting your CSV on GitHub to
producing meaningful insight by running large scale distributed processing.</p>

<h2 id="colophon-why-csv">Colophon: Why CSV?</h2>

<p>This conference isn’t just about <a href="http://data.okfn.org/doc/csv">CSV</a> data. But we chose to call it CSV
Conf because we think CSV embodies certain important qualities that set the
tone for the event:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: CSV is incredibly simple - perhaps the simplest structured data
format there is</li>
  <li><strong>Openness</strong>: the CSV ‘standard’ is well-known and open - free for anyone to use</li>
  <li><strong>Easy to use</strong>: CSV is widely supported - practically every spreadsheet
program, relational database and programming language in existence can handle
CSV in some form or other</li>
  <li><strong>Hackable</strong>: CSV is text-based and therefore amenable to manipulation and access
from a wide range of standard tools (including revision control systems such
as git, mercurial and subversion)</li>
  <li><strong>Big or small</strong>: CSV files can range from under a kilobyte to gigabytes and its
line-oriented structure mean it can be incrementally processed – you do not
need to read an entire file to extract a single row.</li>
</ul>

<p>More informally:</p>

  <p>CSV is the data Kalashnikov: not pretty, but many [data] wars have been
fought with it and even kids can use it. <a href="http://pudo.org/">@pudo</a> (Friedrich Lindenberg)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CSV is the ultimate simple, standard data format - streamable, text-based, no
need for proprietary tools etc <a href="http://rufuspollock.org/">@rufuspollock</a> (Rufus Pollock)</p>
