6/10. Interesting piece, full of brutality and beautiful landscapes. Never quite sure it found its groove instead swaying this way and that culminating in an ending that jumped sideways at the last minute (rather predictably it must be said). Guy Pearce was impressive and striking as Charlie Burns while Ray Winstone delivered a commanding performance in the central role albeit one that was hampered in the closing stages by a lack of material.
