<p><strong><em>This is a joint blog post by Open Knowledge CEO Laura James and Open Knowledge Founder and President Rufus Pollock.</em></strong></p>

<p>In September we <a href="http://blog.okfn.org/2014/09/18/announcing-a-leadership-update-at-open-knowledge/">announced</a> that Laura James, our CEO, is moving on from Open Knowledge and we are <a href="http://blog.okfn.org/2014/11/11/seeking-new-executive-director-at-open-knowledge/">hiring a new Executive Director</a>.</p>

<p>From Rufus: I want to express my deep appreciation for everything that Laura has done. She has made an immense contribution to Open Knowledge over the last 3 years and has been central to all we have achieved. As a leader, she has helped take us through a period of incredible growth and change and I wish her every success on her future endeavours. I am delighted that Laura will be continuing to advise and support Open Knowledge, including joining our Advisory Council. I am deeply thankful for everything she has done to support both Open Knowledge and me personally during her time with us.</p>

<p>From Laura: It’s been an honour and a pleasure to work with and support Open Knowledge, and to have the opportunity to work with so many brilliant people and amazing projects around the world. It’s bittersweet to be moving on from such a wonderful organisation, but I know that I am leaving it in great hands, with a smart and dedicated management team and a new leader joining shortly. Open Knowledge will continue to develop and thrive as the catalyst at the heart of the global movement around freeing data and information, ensuring knowledge creates power for the many, not the few.</p>
