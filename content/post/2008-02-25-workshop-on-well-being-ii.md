Following the [first workshop](http://www.rufuspollock.org/2008/01/22/workshop-on-well-being-i/) a month ago, today I attended the second of a series of "Workshops on Well-being" at the LSE. Below are some (very) impressionistic notes.

## Presentation by Paul Dolan and Robert Metcalfe: Valuing non-market Goods: Preference based and experience based methods

1. How do Value non-market goods?
  * Preferences
    * revealed (observed market behaviour)
    * stated (contingent hypothetical market)
  * Experiences: subjective well-being
  * Traditionally (implicitly) assume all of these are equivalent

4. urban renewal in swansea (from 2001)
  * 2 areas: hafod and landore
  * hafod has had renewal (500/950 homes)
  * landore (675) has not
  * compare the two (omitting those who have not yet had renewal and in-movers)

5. Improvements:
  * front boundary walls
  * street lighting
  * etc
  * landore: house cost 95k, income 16k
  * hafod

6. Estimate revealed preferences using land-registry data and dummy for renewal.

7. WTP: card they fill in saying what they are willing to pay for various improvements (per month for 3 years).

8. "Thinking about your life and personal circumstances, how satisfied are you with your life as a whole?"

9. 364 out of 1625 (22.4%) response rate (low but representative)
  * slightly biased to renewal area

10. Revealed prefs: no effect on prices of renewal (and apparently this had also been found in a much larger

11. WTP: Â£750 over 3 years (Â£250 a year)

12. 6.5% increase in life satisfaction (7.1 to 7.7 on a 10 point scale)
  * controlling for marital status, age, gender, income etc
  * approx 19k in monetary terms
  * but problems of endogeneity of income
  * instrument using partner in employment and rented accommodation well-being hit now is Â£6350
  * cost of renewal was ~14k

13. 2nd experiment: renewal in Port Talbot but not Neath
  * 8k for improvements + Â£250 for home safety per household
  * WTP: Â£500 (over 3 years)
  * SWB: 12.5k
    * but 2.5k for repair and 10k for safety!
    * income instrumented by WTP

14. What explains the discrepancy?
  * revealed preference may be wrong because of unobserved effects (e.g. improvements in Hafod).
  * WTP: evidence that per month/year figures would just go on forever (even though told just for 3 years).
  * SWB Income Compensation: might be discounted PV of long-term benefits.
  * WTP accumulate over 12-20 years (average time people are in the house) or discounted SWB IC over 25 years results in WTP value = SWB IC value.
