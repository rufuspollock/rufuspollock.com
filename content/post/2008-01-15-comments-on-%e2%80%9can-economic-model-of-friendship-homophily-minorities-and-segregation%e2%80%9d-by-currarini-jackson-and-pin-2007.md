**2008-06: There is now a [pdf version of these comments available](/economics/papers/comments_on_currarini_jackson_pin_2007.pdf)**. This may be a better way to read this as some people have reported difficulties with viewing the maths in the page (requires mathml support -- via firefox + mathml fonts or IE).

Back last October I was a participant in a "Networks" reading group that worked through â€œAn Economic Model of Friendship: Homophily, Minorities and Segregationâ€ by Currarini, Jackson and Pin (2007). The discussion at the time encouraged me to expend some effort in order to try and derive some of the paper's results in what I believe is a simpler, and more intuitive, manner.

Having finally got round to writing/marking up my rough notes into computer friendly format (markdown + latexmathml) I've now posted them online at:
