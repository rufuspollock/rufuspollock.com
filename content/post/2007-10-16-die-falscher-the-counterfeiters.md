7/10. A powerful, intense film. The focus on the counterfeiting operation (and the thriller-like aspect of this storyline) by moving the camps largely 'off-stage' acts to intensify the impact and appreciation of their horrors. Rather than simple choices and obvious moralizing we are confronted with ambiguity and complexity, above all in the form of the central character Sally Sorowitsch. The result is one of the best 'fictional' films to be made about the holocaust, vastly superior to the crude cliches and trivial sententiousness of the likes of Schindler's list.
