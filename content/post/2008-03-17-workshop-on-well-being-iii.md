Following on from the [second workshop](http://www.rufuspollock.org/2008/02/25/workshop-on-well-being-ii/) a month ago, today saw the third in the series of "Workshops on Well-being" take place at the LSE. This time the presentation was given by [Andrew Clark of PSE](http://www.pse.ens.fr/clark/). Below are some (very) impressionistic notes.

## Presentation by Andrew Clark on Job Satisfaction: What do we Know and What Next?

1. Job satisfaction (JS) and individual well-being (LS)
  * well-being/LS function LS = f(Job satisfaction, health satisfaction, leisure etc)
  * data in BHPS (waves 6-15 though 11 missing)
  * health/ income / house / spouse / job / social life / amout leisure / use leisure (scale 1-7)
    * all highly significant
    * social life is top, followed by health, use of leisure, income and job satisfaction is last
    * robust to demographic controls
  * But do individual personality types make any difference (fixed effects)

2. Panel results
  * all effects go down (there are 'happy types') except JS (which doubles) though still the smallest
  * Is this ranking unique to Britain?
  * Is it the same for everyone? (subregressions: old/young, men/women; or do a latent class analysis)

3. JS is important to firms as well as it will predict worker behaviour
  * Labour turnover
  * Absenteeism
  * Counter-and non-productive work/productivity
  * Worker quitting (but almost impossible to do properly as quitting is self-reported so unreliable)
    * P(quit(t+1)) = f(JS, X(t))

4. Compare quitting GB and Germany
  * pretty similar, JS is pretty significant

5. Cognitive biases and context in relation to quitting (SPELL data from BHPS)
  * have panel data so can look at series of JS for an individual
  * refers to Kahnemann and Riedelmeier on evaluation of colonoscopy 
    * suggest Peak-End evaluation: evaluations of peak and end point
  * Apply to job quitting (peak-end, min, max, avg, current ...)
    * peak-end does best (followed by running max (close), and current)
  * => behaviour would not then seem to max their utility

6. Try do the same with income but need variations in income (since normally just rises)
  * use truckers as they have exog changes
  * other potential sources: tax changes
  * peak-end divorce

7. Relative income
  * Traditional: W/LS/JS = W(y,...)
  * Comparisons: LS/JS = W(y/yr, ...)
  * yr is comparison/relative income
  * to whom do we compare? (peers, others in HH, spouse, myself in the past, friends, neighbours, work, expectations)
  * Results:
    * +ve effect of income
    * But falling as other's income rises
    * Overall effect is zero: if everyone's income rises then no effect

8. Preference for structure of income
  * same income but in different ways
  * flat slope (A), steeper (+ve) slope (B), and v. +ve slope (C)
  * even though flat slope (using saving to mimic C) would result in being overall better off
    * asked about this (they were told they could this) they still chose C (apparently because of self-control issues -- they wouldn't be able to save)

9. Does other's income always affect one negatively
  * Hirschmann's tunnel effect (happy for something good for you because it means something good is going to happen to me)
  * Danish ECHP (1994-2001): fantastic data (which gave not only individuals but all of their colleage's info including pay)
  * here one does find a +ve effect of others income on me (check how it varies across firm so not just selection effect at firm level) 

10. Do 2 wrongs make a right?
  * Peak-end utility could be thought of as 'correct' as:
    * with adaptation
    * current utility (after something good) understates actual total flow benefits (as one has adapted)
    * PE corrects for this

11. Instrumental uses of JS
  * 'Good job' lit has mainly focused on money
  * But self-employed earn less but are happier (though significat issues about reporting bias)
  * Also why are there different avg. wages in different industries (when they look the same)
    * Compensating differentials vs. rents
  * So let's use JS to explain different 
    * looking at the data: high wage goes with high JS (so suggests this about rents not compensation)

12. Job Quality: Are things going to the dogs?
  * ISSP (repeated XS in 3 waves 1989 - 2005)
  * Multivariate regressions: JS is improving (went down 1989-1997 but bounced back in 2005)  
    * But stressful/dangerous/difficult work has been rising
    * Good job content has been going down.
    * However enough other stuff has been getting better faster (income, opportunities, flexible hours)


## Discussion

  * Paul Dolan:
    * Causality
    * Experienced Utility? Kahnemann would be unhappy
    * Peak-end seems difficult for JS since already a retro-spective evaluation (so peak-end of a peak-end)
  * Gordan:
    * relative ranked position not just compared to the avg
    * care more about those above than those below
    * need to be more specific about form of relativities
  * All: Context, Context, Context
  * RP: Peak-end vs. range-frequency. Take colonoscopy: PE predicts that increasing pain at a single point (early on) would worsen evaluation while range-frequence would predict it would improve evaluation (since you spend more time at a level relatively better than the worst)
  * BHPS: now have a question asking for whether your LS is better/worse than last year
  * Gordan: gratitude is single biggest predictor of happiness
    * individual differences
  * Propensities to adapt
  * Gordon: Andrew Oswald and he also found +ve avg income effects in workplace
  * Judgment vs. Adaptation
  * Paul Dolan: generally we overestimate our +ve attributes but underestimate (their relative) income level
