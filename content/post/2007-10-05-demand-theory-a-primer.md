I've put a basic [primer on demand theory](/economics/notes/demand-theory/) up online in the economics section. I wrote this several years ago and haven't had much chance to update it and there are still several sections marked with TODOs but it does provide a rapid and concise overview of some of the main results. Originally I hoped it (and its companions) might expand into a rudimentary [open textbook](http://www.opentextbook.org/) but at present I see them more as a basis for a putative atlas of economics models -- an alternative and perhaps grander project about which I plan to post at some later point.
