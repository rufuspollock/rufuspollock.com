<p>We’ve just started a mini-project called <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/bad-data/">Bad Data</a>. Bad Data provides real-world examples of how <em>not</em> to publish data. It showcases the poorly structured, the mis-formatted, and the just plain ugly.</p>

<p>This isn’t about being critical but about <strong>educating</strong>—providing examples of how <strong>not</strong> to do something may be one of the best ways of showing how to do it right. It also provides a source of good practice material for budding data wranglers!</p>

<p>Each “bad” dataset on gets a simple page that shows what’s wrong along with a preview or screenshot.</p>

<p>We’ve started to stock the site with some of the better examples of bad data that we’ve come across over the years. This includes machine-<em>un</em>readable <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/bad-data/ex/tfl-passenger-numbers/">Transport for London passenger numbers from the London Datastore</a> and a classic “<a href="http://okfnlabs.org/bad-data/ex/bls-us-employment/">ASCII spreadsheet</a>” from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>

<p><strong>We welcome contributions of new examples! <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/bad-data/add">Submit them here</a>.</strong></p>
