The [lead article](http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2010/01/mash-the-state/) of Prospect Magazine's February issue is a piece by by James Crabtree and Tom Chatfield entitled "Mashing the State". It's an in-depth look at the [recent launch of data.gov.uk](http://data.gov.uk) and its place in the wider context of government policy in relation to information -- as well as information's relation to governance (that "mashing" of the state ...).

[Where Does My Money Go](http://www.wheredoesmymoneygo.org/) gets a mention as does the ["Cambridge" paper on pricing models at trading funds](http://www.rufuspollock.org/2008/03/12/models-of-public-sector-information-provision-via-trading-funds-report-published-today/).
