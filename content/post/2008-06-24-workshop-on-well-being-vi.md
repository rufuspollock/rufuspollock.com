Yesterday I attended the sixth and final of the series of "Workshops on Well-being" taking place at the LSE (I missed the fifth workshop as I was away and so the last one I attended was the [fourth workshop back in April](http://www.rufuspollock.org/2008/04/22/workshop-on-well-being-iv/)). This time the presentations were given by [David Clark](http://www.iop.kcl.ac.uk/staff/profile/default.aspx?go=10813) of KCL and [Martin Knapp](http://www.lse.ac.uk/people/m.knapp@lse.ac.uk/) of LSE and KCL. Below are some heavily impressionistic notes.

## Presentation by David Clark (KCL): Developing Effective Psychological Treatments for Common Mental Health Problems

1. Anxiety disorders
  * ~ 1/2 of mental health problems
  * overly pessimistic view on outcomes etc
  * can become obsessional (+ fear that thoughts are self-realizing)
* If beliefs are inconsistent why do they persist
  * panic attacks (~ 30% have them once/v. occasionally but realize that they are not dying). But in the disorder people might have had them 5000 times -- how can they still think they are dying when it happens again?

2. Research Strategy:
  * identify core cog. abnormality
  * ...

3. Example: social phobia
  * most common anxiety disorder (lifetime prevalence: 12%)
  * persistent: natural recovery rate is 37% over 12 years
  * marked underachievement
  * persists because:
    * shift to internal focus (which means ignore external)
    * use of internal information to infer how one appears to others (and as they are anxious this unreliable)
    * safety behaviour
  * test some of this
    * Do high socially anxious individuals have an internal attentional bias (Mansell, Clark, Ehlers 2003)
    * Evidence that socially anxious individuals have a distorted external perspective (Hackmann, Surawy and Clark 1999)
    * Evidence that onset of phobia correlated some stressful (bad) social event
    * Does negative self-image affect relation with others. Yes, to some extent (another Clark paper)
  * treatment (Cognitive Therapy)
    * attention training
    * drop safety behaviours (to test no adverse consequences)
    * video feedback
    * rescripting early memories
  * does CT pass the randomized controlled trial: YES
    * compare against no treatment
    * placebo
    * at least as effective as medication

4. Common disorders where CBT is effective as a sole treatment (recovery rate, controlled effect size):
  * Major depressive disorder: 50%, -
  * Panic disorder 75%, 2.8
  * PTSD: 80%, 2.3/1.2
  * Social phobia: 75% 2.6
  * Generalized anxiety disorder: 50% (77%)
  * OCD: 45%, 1.5
  * Also show that effects of CBT persist for anxiety (unlike psychotropic interventions where there is a high relapse rate)
    * depression slightly different as naturally recurrent -- though CBT still effective (and complementary to medication). Hollon et al (2005) (Arch Gen Psychiat) compare medication vs CBT over long-term and shows CBT better.

5. Evidence that benefits of CBT extend outside of targeted syndrome. Beneficial effects for:
  * other mental health problems
  * work, family, social adjustment
  * employment (less sick days, moving to work)
  * but these effect sizes are lower bound (overall want SWB scores ...)

6. Developing more effective (shorter) treatments
  * Traditional approach is 1h/w for 3-4 months
    * but 1-2h of 'homework' per day between visits
  * Now trying intensive 1w course (~ as effective at least for PTSD)
  * Also treatments with extra-focus (e.g. social phobia + work: found big impact on time to get back to work)
  * CBT with well-being emphasis. Fava et al (2005) (Psychotherapy and Psychomatics). Find CBT-WB > CBT but tiny sample, no blind assessment etc.

7. Major policy changes underway to increase access to CBT

## Martin Knapp (LSE + KCL): Economics of Mental Health: Some Open Research Questions

1. Why mental health is different
  * breadth/multiplicity of need
  * association with crime + violence
  * associated with suicide
  * compulsion, stigma, complex links with ethnicity

2. Leading policy/practice themes
  1. stigma/rights/social exclusion
  2. funding
  3. Balance of Care
  4. Treatments 
  5. Prevention

3. Social exclusion, stigma, etc
  * Participation-based approach
    * opportunities, socio-economics roles
  * Rights-based approach
    * stigma, discrimination, compulsory treatment
  * If i were suffering from mental health problems I don't want anyone to know (Scotland): 50% in 2002 to 41% in 2006 (following a big campaign)
    * evidence in UK actually may be getting worse (16% 2000 to 22% in 2007 on similar question)
  * Equity: great variations (inequality greater for mental health than for income), esp by ethnicity.
  * Costs:
    * total cost of depression Ã‚Â£9 billion (Thomas and Morris, Brit J Psychiatry 2003)
      * mostly productivity effects (not service or morbidity)
      * prob. underestimate as also have staff turnover, presenteeism
    * major impact of psychosis on life-time development [ed: not exactly surprising ...]
    * homicide: Taylor and Gunn (Brit J Psychiatry) show that across various European countries between 5 and 20% or homicides committed by those who are mentally ill
    
4. Funding
  * Mental health spend as %tage of total public spend: England is highest in EU [ed: is this good or just that England has a lot of mental health issues]
  * Good efficiency arguments for intervening (cost-effective)
    * Schizophrenia: total cost ~ Ã‚Â£54k per person per year (only a 1/3 hits the health system)

5. Balance of Care
  * Massive reduction in number psychiatric beds (personal preferences, social preferences etc)

6. Treatments
  * Does it work?
  * Is it cost-effective? etc
  * In 2000 only 53% of people with depression received treatment compatible with NICE guidelines
  * More attention to non-health interventions
    * particularly risk factors such as bullying, family violence, uncontrolled debt

7. Prevention
  * Inner London Longitudinal Study (ILLS)
    * Study of all 10y old in part of London in 1970
    * Categorise into groups from: "no problems at school" to "conduct disorder"
    * Estimate costs to society per child from 10 to 28 (education, criminal justice, social services etc)
      * no problems: ~ 7k, conduct: ~ 24k, conduct disorder: ~70k (mostly criminal justice)
  * 1970 British Cohort Study
    * earnings at age 30 by childhood need at age 10
    * no probs: ~24k, behavioural (lowest quartile): same, Cognitive (lowest quartile): 15k, emotional (not a great effect but interacts in a minor way with cognitive). Another study finds same effects for behavioural at age 32 but extended to 48 finds same -ve effect of cognitive issues.
