Last week I was in Oxford to give a talk at the IP Seminar on "How Long Should Copyright Last?". I have now posted the [slides from the talk](http://www.rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/copyright_term_and_the_public_domain.html) online.

In addition to covering the basic outline of the optimal term calculation, I was also able to give some results from the recent research on the public domain (see slide 58 onwards).
