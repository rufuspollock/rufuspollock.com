<p>The past few weeks have seen major improvements to the Labs website, another Open Data Maker Night in London, updates to the TimeMapper project, and more.</p>

<h2 id="labs-hangout-today">Labs Hangout: today</h2>

<p>The next Labs online hangout is taking place today in just a few hours—now’s your chance to sign up on <a href="http://pad.okfn.org/p/labs-hangouts">the hangout’s Etherpad</a>!</p>

<p>Labs hangouts are informal online gatherings held on Google Hangout at which Labs members and friends get together to discuss their work and to set the agenda for Labs activities.</p>

<p>Today’s hangout will take place at 1700 - 1800 GMT. Check <a href="http://pad.okfn.org/p/labs-hangouts">the hangout pad</a> for more details, and watch the pad for notes from the meeting.</p>

<h2 id="crowdcrafting-at-citizen-cyberscience-summit-2014">Crowdcrafting at Citizen Cyberscience Summit 2014</h2>

<p>In today’s other news, Labs’s <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/members/teleyinex">Daniel Lombraña González</a> is presenting <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/projects/crowdcrafting-and-pybossa/">Crowdcrafting</a> at the <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/citizen-cyberscience-summit/">Citizen Cyberscience Summit 2014</a>. You can read more about his presentation <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/citizen-cyberscience-summit/sctxth/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Crowdcrafting is an open-source citizen science platform that “empowers citizens to become active players in scientific projects by donating their time in order to solve micro-task problems”. Crowdcrafting has been used by institutions including CERN, the United Nations, and the National Institute of Space Research of Brazil.</p>

<h2 id="labs-site-updates">Labs site updates</h2>

<p>Labs has been discussing improving the website for some time now, and the past weeks have seen many of those proposed improvements being put into action.</p>

<p>One of the biggest changes is a new <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/projects/">projects page</a>. Besides having a beautiful new layout, the new projects page implements <a href="https://github.com/okfn/okfn.github.com/issues/160">filtering</a> by tags, language, and more.</p>

<p>The site now also features a reciprocal linking of users and projects. The projects page now shows projects’ maintainers (n.b. plural!), and users pages now show which projects users contribute to (e.g. <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/members/andylolz/">Andy Lulham’s page</a> highlights his <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/projects/data-pipes/">Data Pipes</a> contributions).</p>

<h2 id="timemapper-improvements">TimeMapper improvements</h2>

<p><a href="http://timemapper.okfnlabs.org/">TimeMapper</a> is a Labs project allowing you to create elegant timelines with inline maps from Google Spreadsheets in a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>A number of improvements have been made to TimeMapper:</p>

<ul>
  <li>support for <a href="https://github.com/okfn/timemapper/issues/121">different types of data views</a> (including simple timeline and map views)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/okfn/timemapper/issues/109">nice URLs for anonymous timemaps</a></li>
  <li>bugfix: <a href="https://github.com/okfn/timemapper/issues/86">missing start date doesn’t cause a crash</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="open-data-maker-night-february">Open Data Maker Night February</h2>

<p>Two weeks ago today, the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/OpenKnowledgeFoundation/London-GB/1093152/">ninth Open Data Maker Night London</a> was hosted by <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/members/andylolz">Andy Lulham</a>. This edition was a <em>mapping special</em>, featuring <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> contributor <a href="http://harrywood.co.uk/">Harry Wood</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://okfnlabs.org/events/open-data-maker/">Open Data Maker Nights</a> are informal, action-oriented get-togethers where <em>things get made</em> with open data. Visit the Labs website for <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/events/open-data-maker/">more information</a> on them, including info on how to host your own.</p>

<h2 id="datapackage--bubbles">DataPackage + Bubbles</h2>

<p>On last week’s newsletter, you heard about <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/members/Stiivi/">S?tefan Urbánek</a>’s  abstract data processing framework <a href="https://github.com/Stiivi/bubbles">Bubbles</a>. S?tefan just notified the OKFN Labs list that he has created a <a href="https://gist.github.com/Stiivi/9104719">demo of Bubbles using Data Packages</a>, Labs’s simple standard for data publication.</p>

<p>“The example is artificial”, S?tefan says, but it highlights the power of the Bubbles framework and the potential of the Data Package format.</p>

<h2 id="get-involved">Get involved</h2>

<p>We’re always looking for new contributions at the Labs. Read about <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/join/">how you can join</a>, and see the <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/ideas/">Ideas Page</a> to get in on the ground floor of a Labs project—or just join the <a href="http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/okfn-labs">Labs mailing list</a> to participate by offering feedback.</p>
