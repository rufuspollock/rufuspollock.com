This Friday and Saturday I'm in Washington DC at the [2010 Online News Association Conference](http://conference.journalists.org/2010conference/) where I'll be speaking about [Where Does My Money Go?](http://www.wheredoesmymoneygo.org/) in the Saturday [session on *Making Killer Apps with Public Data*](http://ona10schedule.journalists.org/type/general+session).

I'll then be travelling up to Boston for a few days to meet with some open data folks there -- if you're in that area and interested in open data or related matters please [get in touch](/about/).
