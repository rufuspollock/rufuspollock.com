7.5/10 *The Santaroga Barrier* by Frank Herbert. Read during my trip to the IIOC. What makes this good (or rather what raises it above the pot-boiler) is precisely those elements that are not science fiction, in particular the examination of different forms of awareness  and their affect on our interpretation of the effects of modernity.
