Courtesy or a kind invitation from Richard Cave, tomorrow I'll be heading over to Warwick University to present in their [IO Seminar](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/news/forums/industrial_org_index/). The talk will be focused on my main 'IP papers':  [Cumulative Innovation, Sampling and the Hold-Up Problem](http://rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/holdup_and_sampling.pdf) and [Imitation and Innovation with and without IP](http://rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/innovation_and_imitation.pdf), but if there's time I might also get the chance to discuss another paper of mine on the [Control of Porting in Two-Sided Markets](http://rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/porting.pdf).
