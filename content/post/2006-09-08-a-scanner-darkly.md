7.5/10. I'm pulled two ways on this one. The film doesn't come together into a coherent work instead veering widly from minority report style thriller to perfectly played comic sketches and back to meditations on the nature of addiction and normalcy. While these individual sections are often brilliant, without any framing plot (or a plot so tentative and fragmentary as to appear absent), the whole ends up being slightly less than the sum of its parts.
