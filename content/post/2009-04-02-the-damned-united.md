6.5/10 (8/10 for "genre"). Small but (almost) perfectly formed. It's hard to imagine many people outside the UK getting excited by this recounting of the ins and outs of Brian Clough's early career as a football manager, but this production was elegantly put together with very effective use of (what look to have been) limited resources. Particularly noteworthy were Sheen's performance and the quality of scene and shot composition (especially striking were several flat-on side-shots, for example that of the quay at the end of Clough and Taylor's falling out argument on their Spanish holiday).
