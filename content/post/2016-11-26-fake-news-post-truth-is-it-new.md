Here are a series of tweets I posted today on the topic of fake news and post-truth politics which are currently received a lot of attention:

1. Is there any systematic evidence that #FalseNews is worse than before or that we are *more* #PostFact in politics? [tweet](https://twitter.com/rufuspollock/status/802414208377823232)
2. E.g. 2004 US presidential election had Swift Boat Veterans for Truth https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_Vets_and_POWs_for_Truth (among other dubious claims) [tweet](https://twitter.com/rufuspollock/status/802414987385905152)
3. People have self-selected into the mini #EchoChamber of TV stations and newspapers for decades [tweet](https://twitter.com/rufuspollock/status/802418212117757952)
4. True, the @Facebook Like has technologically institutionalised a form of informational mob rule on a scale we have never seen before [tweet](https://twitter.com/rufuspollock/status/802418742772822017)
5. Whilst filter bubble of @Facebook newsfeed and @Google results gave us automated echo chambers with zero #Transparency [tweet](https://twitter.com/rufuspollock/status/802419787951472640)
6. All in the service of giving us "what we want" - and, of course, the profit motive (but newspapers and TV had this all too!) [tweet](https://twitter.com/rufuspollock/status/802420229393395712)
7. Even if we are more #PostFact does this just reflect an underlying growth in polarization and populism rather than cause it? [tweet](https://twitter.com/rufuspollock/status/802420904688914432)
8. It is like the old question of whether newspapers shape their readers' views or shape their content to their readers' existing views [tweet](https://twitter.com/rufuspollock/status/802421353227939841)
9. The true answer to that question - and recent controversy is a bit of both and it depends on the topic. [tweet](https://twitter.com/rufuspollock/status/802421674528239616)
10. A big difference in past was fewer choices for news. Theory & evidence suggest lots of choice => more #EchoChamber [tweet](https://twitter.com/rufuspollock/status/802423540582641668)
11. Political news is not a simple commodity like bread or steel [tweet](https://twitter.com/rufuspollock/status/802425005313179648)
12. High quality news & information underpin values like trust, respect, integrity that are foundational to our democracies [tweet](https://twitter.com/rufuspollock/status/802425733079568384)
13. #Marketplace of ideas concept is fundamentally misleading - we do not converge on one truth like we do on one price [tweet](https://twitter.com/rufuspollock/status/802427734169239553)
14. And individually we are far from perfectly rational - we usually ignore evidence contradicting what we already believe [tweet](https://twitter.com/rufuspollock/status/802430642181079041)

One important point, that I did not get to elaborate on in the 140 characters: How the closed information economy is contributing fake news and post-truth politics -- and how an openness could address these problems.

The current closed model has given us monopolies such as Facebook and Google. Experimentation and alternatives mechanisms for online discovery of content have largely been eliminated. Financial incentives drive an echo chamber mentality: maximizing advertising revenue means maximizing time spent on the platform by filling users' newsfeeds or search results with "what they want" -- interpreted in its crudest sense as what they like and click on! This, in turn, has damaging effects on public discourse as bad information drives out good in an informational version of gresham's law (easy to digest emotional soundbites drive out nuanced, evidence based discussion).

So what is the solution? Regulation, such as requiring platforms to vet content, would be addressing the symptom rather than the disease -- and would even help further entrench the monopolies (any entrant would now have to bear similar regulatory burdens but with less financial resources to do so).

Another alternative, is to have the companies themselves self-regulate by checking content themselves. Whilst superficially useful, on further examination this could be disastrous as we hand over even greater power to shape and censor political discourse to these already too powerful commercial entities.

The better solution is a simple one: openness. If we were to open up Google's and Facebook's platform, including their algorithms we would have competition and transparency. Suddenly, experimentation and real alternatives would be possible. Different algorithms would give us different news; and even different business models for producing news -- not least because under the pressure of competition these monopolies would no longer be able to take so much of the value of the content they serve up.

In short, a more open and democratic information economy would give us a more open and democratic politics.
