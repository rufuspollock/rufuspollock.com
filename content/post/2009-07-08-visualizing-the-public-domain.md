Continuing in our series of posts on the [size of the public domain](http://www.rufuspollock.org/2009/06/12/the-size-of-the-public-domain/), here we present some of our previous results graphically.

The following three graphs show the number of items per year and the estimated proportion of these which are public domain based on the catalogue data from three sources: Cambridge University Library (CUL), the British Library (BL), and the Slovakian National Library.

In each graph the black bars indicate the total number of items each year and the red the number which are estimated to be public domain.
