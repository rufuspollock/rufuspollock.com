From apt-cache show:

wdiff' is a front-end to GNU <code>diff</code>.  It compares two files, finding which words have been deleted or added to the first in order to create the second.  It has many output formats and interacts well with terminals and pagers (notably with `less').  `wdiff' is particularly useful when two texts differ only by a few words and paragraphs have been refilled.
