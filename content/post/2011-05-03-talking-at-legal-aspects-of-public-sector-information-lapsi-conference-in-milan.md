This week on Thursday and Friday I'll be in Milan to speak at the 1st [LAPSI (Legal Aspects of Public Sector Information) Primer & Public Conference][lapsi-milan].

I'm contributing to a "primer" session on *The Perspective of Open Data Communities* and then giving a conference talk on *Collective Costs and Benefits in Opening PSI for Re-use* in a session on *PSI Re-use: a Tool for Enhancing Competitive Markets* where I'll be covering work by myself and others on pricing and regulation of PSI (see e.g. the ["Cambridge Study"][cambridge-study] and the paper on the [Economics of the Public Sector of Information][economics]).
