5/10. OK but unconvinced that this was an event of such fascination/significant as to be worthy of a cinematic documentary. By the end was more interested in the personal relationships (and why they broke down) than the tight-rope walk itself. Unfortunately, these other areas remain relatively unexplored (perhaps rather reasonably people didn't want to go into this kind of personal info ...).
