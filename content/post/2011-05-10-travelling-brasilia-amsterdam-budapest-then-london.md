I'm travelling quite a bit over these next few weeks:

  * This week, from Tuesday 10th through Saturday 14th I'm in Brasilia to participate in [CONSEGI][consegi] and talk about [open data][].
  * I'm then in Amsterdam from Sunday 15th through Tuesday 17th to participate in a workshop on [Global Interoperability and Linked Data Workshop][lib-workshop] organized by [Maura Marx][] and colleagues
  * From Wednesday 18th through Friday 20th I'm in Budapest for an [Open Data workshop][budapest-workshop] being co-organized by the [Open Knowledge Foundation][okf] / [LOD2][]
  * Finally on Saturday 21st I'm back in London to speak about [OpenSpending][] at [OpenTech][]
