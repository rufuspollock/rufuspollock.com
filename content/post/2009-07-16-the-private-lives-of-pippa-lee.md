2/10. Terrible. The film is a disaster on every level: a tedious, uninvolving and occassionally laughable plot is married to an unhappy mixture of the non-existent and the cliched characterisation, and then rounded off with dialogue of the utmost banality. Even the presence of a stellar cast (how were they persuaded to get involved?) cannot redeem it, and it is with a genuine sense of relief that one greets the lights going up.
