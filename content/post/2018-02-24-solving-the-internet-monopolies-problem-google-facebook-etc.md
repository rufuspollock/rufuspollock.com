The good news is that an increasing number of people seem to agree that:

1. Facebook, Google etc are monopolies
2. That is a problem

Agreeing we have a problem is always a crucial first step. But to go further we need to:

1. Correctly diagnose the disease -- in particular, avoid confusing the symptoms with the root cause
2. Identify a cure that actually works

On point one, the answer is that he root cause is costless copying (plus platform effects) combined with monopoly rights. Costless copying (and platform effects) would always lead to some kind of standardization -- witness the Internet. But that is not a problem -- in fact it is advantage to have a single standard. The problem arises when the standard platform is owned by one entity and becomes a monopoly as we have today with Google in search, Facebook in social networking etc.

The solution flows from the diagnosis: make these platforms open and have an open-compatible, market-oriented way to pay innovators (i.e. have remuneration rights). By make a platform open I mean make its protocols, algorithms, software and know-how free to all to use, build on and share.

More details on all of this in my upcoming book:

## An example of a mis-diagnosis: privacy ...

One prevalanet misdiagnosis is that the issue with Facebook and Google and the source of (much) of their monopoly power is to do with their control of our personal data. See, for example, the Economist's cover in April 2017 showing Internet monopolies as oil rigs mining personal data -- an allusion to the common assertion that "personal data is the new oil".

From this mis-diagnosis flows a proposed solution: limit Facebook and Google's access to our personal data and/or ensure others have access to that personaol data on equal terms ("data portability").

In fact, personal data is a practical irrelevancies to the monopoly issue. Focusing on it serves only to distract us from the real solutions.

Limiting Facebook's and Google's access to our personal data or making it more portable would make very little difference to their monopoly power and its deleterious effects on innovation and the key freedoms of enterprise, choice and thought.

Why will it make little difference? Because their monopoly just doesn't arise from their access to our personal data. Instead it comes from massive economies of scale (costless copying) plus platform effects. If you removed Google's and Facebook's ability to use personal data to target ads tomorrow it would make very little difference to their top or bottom lines because their monopoly on our attention would be little changed and their ad targeting would be little diminished -- in Google's case the fact you type in a specific search from a particular location is already enough to target effectively and similar Facebook's knowledge of your broad demographic characteristics would be enough given the lock-hold they have on our online attention).

## An example of a misguided solution

Similarly, the idea sometimes put forward that we just need another open-source decentralized social network is completely implausible (even if run by Tim Berners-Lee).[^2]

Platforms/networks like Facebook tend to standardize: witness phone networks, postal networks, electricity networks and even the Internet. We don't want lots of incompatible social networks. We want one open one -- just like we have one open Internet.

In addition, the idea that some open-source decentralized effort is going to take on an entrenched highly resourced monopoly on its own is ludicrous (the only hope would be if there was serious state assistance and regulation -- just in the way that China got its own social networks by effectively excluding Facebook).

Instead, in the case of Facebook we need to address the monopoly at root: networks like this will always tend to standardization. The solution is ensure that we get an open rather than closed (proprietary) global social network (like we got with the open internet).

Right now that would mean enforcing equal access rights to facebook API for competitors or, enforcing full open sourcing of key parts of the software and tech stack and getting guarantees on continued non-discriminatory access.

Even more importantly we need to prevent these kind of monopolies in future -- we want to stop shutting the door after the horse has bolted! This means systematic funding of open protocols and platforms. By open i mean the software, algorithms and non-personal data are open .... The way to do that is replacing patents/copyright with remuneration rights ...

## Fake news: confusing which symptoms are related to which disease

Or even confusing which symptoms are related to which disease. For example, fake news is a symptom only tangentially related to this disease. Fake news is a problem but it is only partially related to monopolisation. The causes of fake news are much more complex than simple monopoly -- in fact, you could argue that more diversity in media actually makes echo chambers worse. Nevertheless, reducing monopoly at Facebook and Google level may bring *some* improvement - see https://rufuspollock.com/2016/11/26/fake-news-post-truth---is-it-news-and-what-can-we-do/
