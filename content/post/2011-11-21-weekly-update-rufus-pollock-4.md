### Availability

* All week
* In South Africa Mon-Thurs (return to UK Friday)

### Activity

* All last week in South Africa for Shuttleworth Fellows meetup
* [Post about meetups and hackdays in South Africa][africa@home]
* [Humanities working group meetup][humanities-meetup]
* Limited coding and contribution to [CKAN][], specifically on:
  * [data package manager][dpm]
  * [Recline Data Explorer][recline] (with Max Ogden) - cf this ticket <http://trac.ckan.org/ticket/1357>
* Work on [v0.11 release][os-0.11] of [OpenSpending][]. In particular updating and improving [openspendingjs][] so that we have a proper bubbletree explorer. Check out, for example [this bubbletree of UK gov expenditure in 2010][ose-ukgov] - which also includes a breakdown (see the donut ring) by region
* OKFN [Dashboard hackday](http://wiki.okfn.org/Community_Dashboard_Hackday_Nov_2011)
* [Africa at Home hackday][africa@home] where I worked on [PyBossa - an opensource crowdsourcing engine][PyBossa]. PyBossa is a port the BOSSA crowdsourcing engine to python (a bit like an opensource mechanical turk but without money!) and with an initial focus on helping scientists and other researchers crowd-source human problem-solving skills!
