Back on June 19th I presented <a href="http://www.thefactz.org/economics/papers/holdup_and_sampling.pdf">Cumulative Innovation, Sampling and the Hold-up Problem</a> (pdf) (<a href="http://www.thefactz.org/economics/papers/holdup_and_sampling/cumulative_innovation_short.xml">xml src version</a>) at the 2006 DRUID conference on Knowledge, Innovation and Competitiveness. If you want to get a sense of paper without reading the whole thing there is <a href="http://www.thefactz.org/economics/papers/holdup_and_sampling/talk/">a set of summary slides</a>.
