### Abstract

There has been growing interest, especially in government, in 'open
data'. This talk will explain what open data is, why it is important
and go on to cover some of the Open Knowledge Foundation's recent work
in this area.

### About the Open Knowledge Foundation

The Open Knowledge Foundation has been a pioneer in the field of open
data since its inception in 2004. It works in a wide array of areas
from sonnets to statistics, genes to geodata. Its open-source [CKAN](http://ckan.org/) software powers <http://data.gov.uk/>,
<http://thedatahub.org/> and dozens of other open data hubs around the
world. For more information about the Foundation see <http://okfn.org/>
and <http://okfn.org/projects>.
