I will be hosted by the [Public Service Reform Unit](http://essexpartnership.org/content/about) and the [University of Essex](http://www.essex.ac.uk/), at their event [*Innovation Talks - Big Data versus Big Brother*](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/innovation-talks-big-data-versus-big-brother-tickets-35429178627) on the 13th of July.

*How do we make the best use of technology and data without losing sight of people?*

*I will be focusing on on the impact that data can have on our decision-making and how we can create data systems to support the public sector and build the communities and capabilities to use that insight to drive change.*
