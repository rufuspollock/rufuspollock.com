From Laslett 'Phillipe AriÃ¨s and "La Famille"' p.83 (quoted in [Eisenstein, p.131](http://openlibrary.org/b/OL17627927M/printing_press_as_an_agent_of_change)):

> The actual reality, the tangible quality of community life in earlier towns or villages ... is puzzling ... and only too susceptible to sentimentalisation. People seem to want to believe that there was a time when every one belonged to an active, supportive local society, providing a palpable framework for everyday life. But we find that the phenomenon itself and its passing -- if that is what, in fact happened-- perpetually elude our grasp.
