Pankaj Mishra, in a review of Suketu  Mehta's <em>Maximum City: Bombay Lost and Found</em> repeats the following anecdote from that book (NYRB, 2004-11-18, p.18):

<blockquote>
  <p>
    In another scene, Chopra, the film director Mehta has worked with, stands before a row of cable operators arrested for screening illegally his new film and orders a pliant police officer to <q>break their legs</q>.
  </p>
</blockquote>
