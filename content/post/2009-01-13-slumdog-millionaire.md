7/10. The first section of film was excellent. This was the part covering our hero's life story up to the present via the (nice) conceit of explaining to the police of how he knows 'all the answers'. Unfortunately, the second part, which takes place in the present was much less good. Not only was the gangster aspect of it cliched and rushed but the love story -- supposedly central to the film -- had little time to develop and remained unconvincing.

As a result rather than ending at a climax the film felt like it had been gently deflating for the final 20 minutes or so. Nevertheless, even if it coasted up to the buffers, the start was more than strong enough to ensure this held the attention and overall this was good entertainment.
