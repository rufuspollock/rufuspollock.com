<p>
  This is definitely up there for the <em>greatest myth of all time</em> award. Strong overtones of intellectual quackery and really begs the question of why did so many fall for this? Readings:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Richard Webster: <em>Why Freud was Wrong</em></li>
  <li>Geoffrey Masson: <em>Assault on Truth</em>, <em>Against Therapy</em></li>
  <li>Richard McNally: <em>Remembering Trauma</em></li>
</ol>
