<h3 id="what">What</h3>

<p>Open Data Maker Nights are informal events focused on “making” with open data – whether that’s creating apps or insights. They aren’t a general meetup – if you come, expect to get pulled into actually building something, though we won’t force you!</p>

<h3 id="who">Who</h3>

<p>The events usually have short introductory talks about specific projects and suggestions for things to work on – it’s absolutely fine to turn up knowing nothing about data or openness or tech as, there’ll an activity for you to help and someone to guide you in contributing!</p>

<h3 id="organize-your-own">Organize your own!</h3>
