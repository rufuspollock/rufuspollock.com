6/10. This was my first experience of work by the legendary Taiwanese director Huo Hsiao-Hsien. Very art-house. After a promising start with some brilliant visual imagery such as the running shadow of the bicycle by the third episode the langorous pace and cryptic approach to characterisation and plot had started to irk. Best described as like being immersed immensely slowly in very cold water: at first exhilirating and hypnotic but eventually painful, tedious and interminable.
