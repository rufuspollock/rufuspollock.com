A few members of the [Open Knowledge Foundation's][okfn] nascent [open economics working group][openecon] are having a code-sprint this Friday and Saturday to work on an app for the world bank competition currently called 'Open HDI' (Human Development Index):

 * **[Update] <http://yourtopia.net> we've renamed to YourTopia** 
 * <strike><http://openhdi.org/></strike> - stub website (it's what we'll make today and tomorrow!)
 * <http://okfnpad.org/openhdi> - planning pad
 * <http://bitbucket.org/okfn/openhdi> - source code and data

[okfn]: http://okfn.org/
[openecon]: http://wiki.okfn.org/wg/economics

The idea is to look at 'development beyond GDP' by collecting weightings on particular aspects of 'development' (health, education, gdp, inequality) from users and using that to build our own human development index.

We first talked about this a few months ago at the open economics online meetup. Dirk Heine and Guo Xu then put together an excellent demo version: <http://eutopia.guoxu.org/> and now we're working to take that to the status of a full app!
