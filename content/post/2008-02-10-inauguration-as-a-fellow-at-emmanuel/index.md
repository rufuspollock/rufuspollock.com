Today is the day of my official inauguration as a Fellow at Emmanuel College, Cambridge (note I was appointed and took up the position last September). This is not something I ever thought would happen and am both privileged and a bit shocked -- now I can walk on the grass!

Here I am dressed up in a suit for the occasion.
