This week I've been at the [ZEW summer workshop on *The Economics of Information and Communication Technologies: A European and International Perspective*](http://www.zew.de/en/veranstaltungen/details.php?LFDNR=624) in Mannheim. I presented my paper on the [The Control of Porting in Two-Sided Markets](http://www.rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/porting.pdf) ([slides here](http://www.rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/porting_talk.pdf)) and [commented on *The Impact of Information Diffusion on Bidding Behaviour and Seller Profit in Name-Your-Own-Price Markets*](http://www.rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/hinz_and_spann_comments_zew_summer_2007.pdf) by Oliver Hinz and Martin Spann.
