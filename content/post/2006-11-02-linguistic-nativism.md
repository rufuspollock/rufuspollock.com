Wrongness of Chomsky's (and Pinker's) arguments for Linguistic nativism. See: <http://www.grsampson.net/REmpNat.html>

Interesting example of how popular science can be very misleading. Pinker (and Chomsky) write very well (and have big impressive sounding titles) yet are purveying a viewpoint that is controversial (or worse: already discredited) in proper scientific circles.
