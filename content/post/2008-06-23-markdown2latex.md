A new version (v1.2) of [my python script for converting markdown to latex](http://www.rufuspollock.org/2006/11/30/mkdn2latex-a-python-script-to-convert-markdown-to-latex/) is now done. markdown2latex (renamed from mkdn2latex) has been extensively refactored to become a proper python-markdown extension. This means it can be used seemlessly alongside plain markdown conversion, as well as independently whether as a module or, in its classic form, from the command line.

In addition for ease of installation it has also been turned into a proper python package and registered on pypi so you can just do:

    $ easy_install markdown2latex

Alternatively you can still get it straight from the repository at:
