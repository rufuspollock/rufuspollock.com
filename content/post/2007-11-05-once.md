4/10. An extended music video for an unimpressive set of songs -- the addition of the love/friendship story between our singer hero and the Czech immigrant cleaner girl did little to leaven the basic ingredients with anything more substantial. Compared to [Small Engine Repair](/2007/09/22/small-engine-repair/), another recent Irish indie also in possession of a singer/songwriter central character, this was poor fare indeed.
