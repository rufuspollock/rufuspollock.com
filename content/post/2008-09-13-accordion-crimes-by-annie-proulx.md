7/10. Extensive in its imagination but losing some of its power by this very fact as the stories start to blur and something of its early intensity is lost as we head into the closing sections. Overall a very dark (and probably correct) vision of the immigrant experience in the US: all prejudice, death and broken families -- at least as I can remember, there was not one happy relationship or family recorded in these 380 odd pages.
