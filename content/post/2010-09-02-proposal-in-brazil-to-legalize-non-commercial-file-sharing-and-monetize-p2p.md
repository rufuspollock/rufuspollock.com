[Pedro ParanaguÃ¡](http://pedroparanagua.net/2010/09/02/brazils-proposal-on-monetizing-p2p/) points me to [a proposal for monetizing P2P file-sharing](http://www.gpopai.usp.br/compartilhamento/) in Brazil.

The proposal has been submitted as part of Brazil's open public consultation to review its copyright law. As he summarizes it for non-Portugese speakers like myself (though Google translate did not do a bad job!):

> Basically, non-commercial file sharing will be authorized â€“ should the proposal be accepted and passed into law. Each broadband user will pay a  R$3 (or US$1.71) fee  together with her/his monthly Internet Service Provider (ISP) bill. The ISP will collect the fees and distribute it to a collecting society comprised of authorsâ€™ associations that will then distribute the collected fees to authors, composers, and so on in the proportion that the works are downloaded.
