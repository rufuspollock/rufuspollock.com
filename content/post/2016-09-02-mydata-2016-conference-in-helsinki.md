MyData is about how we should get to manage our personal data. This is data about us often of a private nature. Data like our health records, or what we bought at the store or where we've been (tracked nowadays by our mobile phones). Increasing amounts of this data like this is out there. Usually it is held by companies and governments and we have limited access and control over how it is used.
