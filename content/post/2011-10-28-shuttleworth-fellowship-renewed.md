Last year I had the great fortune to be supported, in the role of a Fellow, by the [Shuttleworth Foundation][shuttleworth] in my work to help [Bootstrap the Open Data Ecosystem][bootstrap].

Not only was it great to have the resource to dedicate myself full-time to this area, but as a Fellow you get the (rare) chance to be part of a small, tight-knit group of really [smart, interested and, well, just, incredibly nice set of people][fellows] who share your interests and are able to offer constructive, critical feedback and support on what you are doing -- the other place I know like this is the [Open Knowledge Foundation][okfn] ;-).

(By the way, deadline for Spring 2012 Fellowship applications closes on the 1st of Nov and it's really [easy to apply][apply] so if you're interested it's not too late, just head over to [Shuttleworth Fellowship application page][apply] right now).

I've really enjoyed my time as a Fellow over the last year and I'm delighted to report that Shuttleworth have been kind enough to **accept my reapplication and renew my fellowship for a further year**. Reflecting the evolution and maturing of the open data ecosystem this year's proposal was entitled "Scaling the Open Data Ecosystem" to contrast with last year's "Bootstrapping".

In a follow up post next week I'll be outlining what I'm planning to get up to in the coming year with Shuttleworth's support.
