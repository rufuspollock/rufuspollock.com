<p class="caption" style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-top: -18px;">An informal group discussion on open government data</p>

<p>The aim is for this to be informal with lots of open space and a collaboratively organized schedule with activities and discussions like:</p>

<ul>
<li>What does civil society want from OGP?</li>
<li>What&#8217;s next for open government data and open government?</li>
<li>Small group conversations about challenges and what can be learnt from other initiatives like EITI, IATI and the like</li>
<li>Workshops and data expeditions</li>
<li>Space for individual communities groups to meet, share and plan</li>
<li><em>Your suggestion here</em></li>
</ul>
