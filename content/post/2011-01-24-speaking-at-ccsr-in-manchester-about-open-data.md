### Seminar Info

Title: Open Data: What, Why How!

There has been growing interest in many circles, and especially in
government regarding 'open data'. In this talk I explain what open is,
what's its attraction is, especially for public sector information,
from an economic and policy standpoint, and finally explain how
governments and others can adopt this new approach.
