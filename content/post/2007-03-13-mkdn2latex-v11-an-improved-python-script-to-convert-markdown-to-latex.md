I've updated [mkdn2latex](http://project.knowledgeforge.net/okftext/svn/trunk/python/mkdn2latex.py) the python script which converts markdown to latex (see also [the original release announcement](http://www.rufuspollock.org/archives/144)). Changes include:

  * Support for markdown code blocks and html pre/code blocks generally using latex verbatim
  * Verified compatibility with markdown 1.6
  * A few minor bugfixes
