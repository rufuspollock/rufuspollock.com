Yesterday I was at [RE:PUBLICA XI][republica] to give [a talk][talk] on Open Government Data in the opening session of the "open" stream. The crammed to over-capacity room was a nice indicator of the growing attention and interest being generated by [open data][opendata], and especially [open governernment data][ogd]. [Slides online here][slides] and below.
