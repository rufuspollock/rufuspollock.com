Iâ€™ll be giving a talk at [Open Tech 2008](http://www.ukuug.org/events/opentech2008/) on Saturday (5th July) about some of the work I do at the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://www.okfn.org/). The talk is entitled â€œOpening Dataâ€ and its rough subject is indicated by the blurb:

> We all want more open data to analyse and mashup be it for urban planning or to better understand 12th Century Canon Law. But how do we go about reaching data 'Nirvana'? What are the obstacles and why is openness so crucial to getting there? This talk explores these questions touching on some of the more prominent recent developments in the area along the way.

OpenTech/NotCon has been a great experience [over](http://www.xcom2002.com/nc04/) [the years](http://www.ukuug.org/events/opentech2005/) and this time looks to be no exception.
