6.5. *Zodiac* by David Fincher. Never quite sure what it was to become -- a study of obsession, a meditation on the what can and cannot be known, a serial-killer murder mystery. Ultimately it succeeded as none of these but it did at least provide far more thoughtful Hollywood far than usual. 

(To compare Summer of Sam and that Korean 'based-on-real-life' rape case -- whose name I forgot -- both addressed similarish subject matter in a more compelling way).
