6.5/10. The latest Coen brothers outing is well-made and as dark as one would expect a film derived from a Cormac McCarthy novel to be. However this darkness presents difficulties: in a film in which the only main surviving characters are a sheriff losing hope in humanity and a psychopath[^1] who are we left to care for?

[^1]: A psychopath whose resemblance to Death in his fundamental amorality is so striking that it must surely be intentional. The character provides yet another opportunity for a standout performance by Javier Bardem.
