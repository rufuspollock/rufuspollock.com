Last year I collated and distilled the notes and summaries accumulated over the PhD into a proper paper which could act as the literature review in my dissertation. While I submitted the PhD last August I've only just got around to posting this up and it can now be found at:

<http://www.rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/economics_of_knowledge_review.pdf>

From the abstract:

> A selective review of the existing theoretical literature related to the economics of knowledge with particular attention to intellectual property, especially in the form of patents.

Note for those seeking the references they can all be found in the economics bibliography found at:
