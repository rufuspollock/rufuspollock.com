<p>7.5 (8.5 for genre). Stylish with an excellent lead performance (its pared down presentation and plot had echoes of the classic Point Blank).</p>
<p>Though lacking in any great substance (cf, to say, The American) it consistently held one's attention from the very first shot to the closing credits -- something to be said of very few films of this kind.</p>
