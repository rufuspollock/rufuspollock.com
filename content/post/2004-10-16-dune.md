8.5/10. One of the all-time greats of scifi. I've now read 2-3 times over the years a fact that is itself testament to its quality (very little scifi justifies a reread let alone a rereread). I include here the wonderful Litany Against Fear (p. 19 of Dune)

**The Bene Gesserit Littainy Against Fear**

<pre>
I must not fear.
Fear is the mind-killer.
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
Only I will remain.
</pre>
