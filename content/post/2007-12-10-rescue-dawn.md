5.5/10. The latest outing from Werner Herzog features Christian Bale in the based-on-true-life story of a German-born US pilot who escapes from a hellish NV/VietCong prisoner of war camp after being shot-down and captured over Laos during the early stages of the Vietnam War. While better than Herzog's last fiction outing (the abysmal *Invincible*) this is still is a long way from Herzog's brilliant and haunting best as found in the likes of Aguirre, Wrath of God and Fitzcarraldo.
