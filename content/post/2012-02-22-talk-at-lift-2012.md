## Abstract

Over the past few years, there has an explosive growth in open data
with significant uptake in government, research and elsewhere. Open
data has the potential to transform society, government and the
economy, from how we travel to work to how we decide to vote. But we
have only just begun down this road, and the going, even so far, has
not always been easy.

This talk will introduce the idea of open data, explain how, and why,
we are where we are today, and, finally, look to the future of the
rapidly evolving open data ecoystem.
