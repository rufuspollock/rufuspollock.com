7.5/10. (2004-?). Beginning with the central character attempting suicide by driving at full speed into a wall this film continues to assault and grip the audience in equal measure. Centred on the story of the marriage of convenience between two Germans from immigrant turkish families the film is a powerful tale of love, redemption and desolation.
