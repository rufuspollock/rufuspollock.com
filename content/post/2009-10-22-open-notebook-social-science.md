The other day I posted up some work-in-progress on the subject of [patterns of knowledge production](/2009/10/15/exploring-patterns-of-knowledge-production-2/).

That material is still in a fairly preliminary state. However, my decision to release it it in this form was a conscious decision and part of an ongoing attempt on my part to practice a more open "release early, release often" approach to research.

In doing this I'm drawing direct inspiration from the open source and [open notebook (science)][ons] communities and seeking to engage in what might be termed **open notebook social science**!

I think most researchers (including myself) feel a reluctance to put out material that isn't at a reasonable level of maturity. While there are some good reasons for this, I think the main motivations are less positive, and are primarily to do with fear: be it of criticism or that your ideas are "taken" by others. While such fears can have some basis, it seems to me the benefits of an open approach -- in terms of visibility, dissemination, and potential for collaboration -- significantly outweigh any of the associated risks. 

Over the last year, I've already been making some effort to [move][1] [in][2] [this][3] [direction][4] but from this point on I'm aiming to do this more thoroughly and methodically. A first step in this will be to put all the "patterns" and data online.
