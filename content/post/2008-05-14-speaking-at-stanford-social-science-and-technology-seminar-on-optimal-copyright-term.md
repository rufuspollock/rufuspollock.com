Today I'll be presenting my paper [Forever Minus a Day? Theory and Empirics of Optimal Copyright Term](http://www.rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/optimal_copyright_term.pdf) at Stanford in the [Social Science and Technology Seminar Series](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/node/5635) (also [here](http://siepr.stanford.edu/programs/SST_Seminars/index.html)).

This new paper is a heavily revised version of the copyright-term specific portions of my original 'Forever Minus a Day' paper (see [post from last summer](http://www.rufuspollock.org/2007/07/09/forever-minus-a-day-some-theory-and-empirics-of-optimal-copyright/)). The rest of the original paper can now be found in [Optimal Copyright over Time: Technological Change and the Stock of Works](http://www.rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/optimal_copyright_over_time.pdf) which was published in the December issue of the Review of Economic Research on Copyright Issues (RERCI).

**Update post-talk (2008-05-16):** the slides are now online at:
