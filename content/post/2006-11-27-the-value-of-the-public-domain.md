Back in July the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) published, as part of the their series on IP and the Public Sphere, my paper entitled [*The Value of the Public Domain*](http://www.ippr.org/publicationsandreports/publication.asp?id=482). This essay was't intended to be original research but rather to provide an overview of the social and commercial benefits to be derived from open (public-domain) approaches to knowledge production.

Since publication, the paper has managed to travel fairly widely (helped I hope by its [open](http://okd.okfn.org/) licence) including a [recent appearance on Lessig's blog](http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/003593.shtml) so its appropriate that I've now, finally, got around to adding it to the listing on [my economics papers page](http://www.rufuspollock.org/economics/). I've also put up [an html version](http://www.rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/value_of_the_public_domain.html) though not the plaintext (markdown-formatted) source (email me at comments at rufus dot pollock dot org if you want this version).
