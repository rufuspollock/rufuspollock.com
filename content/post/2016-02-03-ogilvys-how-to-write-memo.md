David Ogilvy's 1981 memo to staff at Ogilvy & Mather.

I have read and re-read this several times over the years and found it useful -- though I emphasize that is not the same as thinking it completely correct, for example, there are clear counter-examples to the claim that "People who think well, write well".

Posting here for my own archival and re-findable purposes.

> The better you write, the higher you go in Ogilvy & Mather. People who think well, write well.
>
> Woolly minded people write woolly memos, woolly letters and woolly speeches.
>
> Good writing is not a natural gift. You have to learn to write well. Here are 10 hints:
>
> 1. Read the Roman-Raphaelson book on writing. Read it three times.
> 2. Write the way you talk. Naturally.
> 3. Use short words, short sentences and short paragraphs.
> 4. Never use jargon words like reconceptualize, demassification, attitudinally, judgmentally. They are hallmarks of a pretentious ass.
> 5. Never write more than two pages on any subject.
> 6. Check your quotations.
> 7. Never send a letter or a memo on the day you write it. Read it aloud the next morningâ€”and then edit it.
> 8. If it is something important, get a colleague to improve it.
> 9. Before you send your letter or your memo, make sure it is crystal clear what you want the recipient to do.
> 10. If you want ACTION, don't write. Go and tell the guy what you want.
