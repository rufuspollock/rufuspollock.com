The Open Knowledge Foundation's 2009 [Open Knowledge Conference (OKCon)](http://www.okfn.org/okcon/), which I help organize, will take place next Saturday 28th March - less than a week away.

Full details including programme can be found either in [this blog post](http://blog.okfn.org/2009/03/22/open-knowledge-conference-okcon-2009-saturday-28th-march/) or on the [OKCon home page](http://www.okfn.org/okcon/).

As usual this will be a fun and informal day so if you're free this Saturday and interested in "Open" stuff come along to UCL and take part.

I should also add that for the two days before (Thursday + Friday) there is also the [5th COMMUNIA Workshop which is about Accessing, Using, Reusing Public Sector Content and Data](http://blog.okfn.org/2009/03/18/5th-communia-workshop-programme-details/) which is being co-organized by the Open Knowledge Foundation together with the London School of Economics and taking place at LSE (all thanks to the tireless work of Jonathan Gray and Prodromos Tsiavos!).
