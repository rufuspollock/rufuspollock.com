8/10 (for its category). An intelligent heist movie with a twist, the film is lifted by good performances - Denzel Washington rolls out the usual charm, excellent cinematography and the occasional shot of Spike Lee's biting wit. A more mainstream foray than usual for Lee, he delivers a well above average example of the genre.
