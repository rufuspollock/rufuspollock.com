7.5/10 (2006-02-02). <strong>Very</strong> impressive debut feature from Gela Babluani shot in a grainy black and white and with an atmospheric score. The film grips from the word go and after the plot's secret is revealed the tension is built up with consumate skill. My only gripe is the ending where it seems the Babluani couldn't work out which way to go and ends up dissipating the film's energy in an implausible and sudden denouement. Nevertheless it remains an excellent low-budget thriller and I would put a lot of money on seeing this turn up as an inferior Hollywood remake shot in full technicolour with a big-name star.
