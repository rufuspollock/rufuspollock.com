Following up on their commitments in the 2008 Budget (see [previous post dealing on publication of 'Cambridge Study' ](/2008/03/12/models-of-public-sector-information-provision-via-trading-funds-report-published-today/) today BERR and HMT [announced a review of Trading Funds](http://www.shareholderexecutive.gov.uk/publications/pdf/tradingfunds250608.pdf). It will be run by the Shareholder Executive with input from HMT and OPSI. The main task of this review, according to the announcement, is to:

> ... examine the impact on the trading fundsâ€™ business models of
any changes to the current pricing, accessing and licensing regimes with the
aim of:
>
>   *  distinguishing more clearly what information is required by Government for public policy
>   *  ensuring that this information is available as widely as possible in order
>       to maximise the benefits to the wider UK economy, at a price that
>       balances the provision of such access with the need for users to make a
>       fair contribution to the cost of collecting the information in the long
>       term.
>
> The policy objectives of each of the trading funds will not form part of the
assessment, but the review will consider the future of the trading fund model
and how it impacts on the delivery of these objectives.
