> Every enterprise requires simple, clear, and unifying objectives. Its mission has to be clear enough and big enough to provide a common vision. The goals that embody it have to be clear, public, and often reaffirmed. We hear a great deal of talk these days about the culture of an organization. But what we really mean by this is the commitment throughout an enterprise to some common objectives and common values. Without such commitment there is no enterprise, there is only a mob. Management's job is to think through, set, and exemplify those objectives, values, and goals.

Quoted in Hidden Champions of the Twenty-First Century by Hermann Simon
