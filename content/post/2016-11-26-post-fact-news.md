Is there any systematic evidence that false-news is worse than before or that we are *more* post-fact in politics? E.g. 2004 US presidential election had [Swift Boat Veterans for Truth](https://t.co/tsSLBjE8dE)  (among other dubious claims)

People have self-selected into the mini echo-chamber of TV stations and newspapers for decades. The Facebook ‘Like’ has technologically institutionalised a form of informational mob-rule on a scale we have never seen before. Whilst the filter bubble of Facebook newsfeed and Google results gave us automated echo-chambers with zero transparency. All in the service of giving us "what we want", and, of course, the profit motive (but newspapers and TV had this all too!).

Even if we are more post-fact does this just reflect an underlying growth in polarization and populism rather than cause it? It is like the old question of whether newspapers shape their readers' views or shape their content to their readers' existing views.

The true answer to that question - and recent controversy is a bit of both and it depends on the topic.
A big difference in the past was fewer choices for news. Theory and evidence suggest lots of choice. Political news is not a simple commodity like bread or steel. High quality news and information underpin values like trust, respect, integrity that are foundational to our democracies.

The marketplace-of-ideas concept is fundamentally misleading - we do not converge on one truth like we do on one price. And individually we are far from perfectly rational - we usually ignore evidence contradicting what we already believe.
