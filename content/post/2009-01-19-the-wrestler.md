7/10. Still fairly unrelenting in his doom and gloom (cf. Requiem for a Dream) Aronofsky returns with a star turn by Mickey Rourke as an aging wrestler. More engaging than previous Aronofsky outings -- in part because we were given some grounds for hope (even if they were later taken away) -- this was definitely worth the watch.
