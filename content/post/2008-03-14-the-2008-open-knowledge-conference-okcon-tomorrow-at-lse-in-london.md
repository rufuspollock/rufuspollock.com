The second (or third depending on how you are counting) [Open Knowledge Conference (OKCon)](http://www.okfn.org/okcon/) which is organized by the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://www.okfn.org/) and which I help coordinate is [on tomorrow at LSE in London](http://blog.okfn.org/2008/03/14/the-2008-open-knowledge-conference-okcon-is-on-tomorrow-at-lse-in-london/).

There are a lot of [good sessions](http://www.okfn.org/okcon/programme) and so if you are interested in [open knowledge](http://www.opendefinition.org) and have Saturday free why not come along.
