See the excellent [Deardorff's Glossary of International Economics](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/).  
  
  
**GATT** | General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT)  
---|---  
**MAI** | Multilateral Agreement on Investments  
**MFN(T)** | Most Favoured Nation (Treatment). Used to refer to trading relationships where country A grants country B special status. Many WTO agreements (e.g. GATS article II) explicitly prohibit this behaviour mandating that every country A must grant treatment to a foreign country no less favourable than it grants to any other.  
**NTB** | Non-Tariff-Barrier (to trade). For example regulations or laws that discriminate against foreign trade.  
**Pareto Efficiency** | Means the same as Pareto Optimal=A situation in which no Pareto-improving change is possible (pareto-improving=Making no one worse off and making at least one person better off). (Taken from Deardorff's glossary - see link at top of page).
