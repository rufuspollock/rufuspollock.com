## Papers: Innovation, Knowledge Production and Openness

(In approximate reverse chronological order)

### The Size and Value of the Public Domain

  * [The Size of the EU Public Domain](/papers/size_of_the_public_domain_eu.pdf) (Autumn 2010)

     > This paper reports results from a large recent study of the public domain in the European Union. Based on a combination of catalogue and survey data our figures for the number of items (and works) in the public domain extend across a variety of media and provide one of the first quantitative estimates of the 'size' of the public domain in any jurisdiction. We find that for books and recordings the public domain is around 10-20% of published extant output and would consist of millions and hundreds of thousands of items respectively. For films the figure is dramatically lower (almost zero). We also establish some interesting figures relevant to the orphan works debate such as the number of catalogue entries without any identified author (approximately 10%).

  * [The Value of the EU Public Domain](/papers/value_of_the_public_domain_eu.pdf)

     > This paper reports results from a large recent study of the public domain in the European Union. Based on a combination of catalogue, commercial and survey data we present detailed figures both on the prices (and price differences) of in copyright and public domain material and on the usage of that material.  Combined with the estimates for the size of the EU public domain presented in the companion paper our results allow us to provide the first quantitative estimate for the `value` of the public domain (i.e. welfare gains from its existence) in any jurisdiction. We also find clear, and statistically significant, differences between the prices of in-copyright and public-domain in the two areas which we have significant data: books and sounds recordings in the UK. Patterns of usage indicate a significant demand for public domain material but limitations of the data make it difficult to draw conclusions on the impact of entry into the public domain on demand.

### The Dissemination of Scholarly Information: Old Approaches and New Possibilities

[The Dissemination of Scholarly Information: Old Approaches and New Possibilities](/papers/scholars_and_journals.pdf) (pdf) with Omar Al-Ubaydli

  * July 2009
  * Current methods of disseminating scholarly information focus on the use of journals who retain exclusive rights in the material they publish. Using a simple model, this paper explores the technological reasons for this choice in the past, why it is no longer efficient and how it could be improved upon. (See [this post for a longer overview](/2009/07/20/the-dissemination-of-scholarly-information-journals-open-access-and-distributed-filtering/))
