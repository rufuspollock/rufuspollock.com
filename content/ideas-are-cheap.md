> Ideas are cheap, implementation is costly.

I've been using this and variants of this since the mid 2000s.

It conveys a fundamental point not only about things we create be they a products, a research project or a community but also about life generally -- it is simple to imagine playing the piano like Glenn Gould but it is a years or effort to even try, concentrating on your breath for 30 minutes is easy to understand and hard to do.

There are, of course, some caveats. *Good* ideas are not necessarily cheap, especially in areas like academic research. Good here usually means something like an idea which is reasonably original (no immediate prior art) and with a good chance of success. (Thanks to my friend Liam for emphasizing this point).
