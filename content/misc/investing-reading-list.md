Classics

* Intelligent Investor by Graham
* Security Analysis by Graham and Dodd
* Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits by Philip Fisher. The classic text for growth investing [ed: personally i did not get a lot from this and find the "rules" impracticable. The brutal introduction by his son is also revealing. However, emphasis on (endless) diliegence in investing was useful]
* Reminiscences of a Stock Market Operater by Lefevre. Interesting both for insights on trading and of Wall Street in the early 20th century.
* Where Are the Customers' Yachts?: Or A Good Hard Look at Wall Street by Fred Schwed. Interesting and funny but not a lot of actionable investment info.
* Margin of Safety by Seth Klarman. Short but some nice examples and re-emphasis of the basic value investing principles. Plus diligence, always diligence.
  * 
* Berkshire Hathaway annual letters by Warren Buffet (read every one). You can get these from BH websitr
  * Max Olson has done us a great service and created http://www.berkshireletters.com/ which gives a nice PDF copy
  * Max Olson has also collected the Blue Chip Stamps letters https://www.gitbook.com/book/maxolson/blue-chip-stamps/details
* Fairfax annual letters by Prem Watsa. Not quite as good (or as long-running) as Buffet but still excellent.
* You Can be a Stock Market Genius by Joel Greenblatt. Very good and a nice intro to special situations (esp spin-offs).


Series / Interviews

* Money Masters by John Train. Fascinating (it talked to many of the greats) plus full of interesting asides and a far cry from an average investment book (Train was obviously an erudite and intellectual man - like Graham really). Final short essay in first book about not obsessing about money is fascinating - and right.
* Market Wizards by Jack Schwager. Whole series is good and provides a lot of insight into psychology and practice of trading.

Strategies

* Contrarian Investment Strategy - first major articulation of the rotating low PE strategy. Plus interesting thoughts on psychology

General

* Supermoney by Adam Smith. Not really so much about investment (though you will learn stuff) as a brilliant, witty reflection both on what investing tells us about ourselves and the state of america in the 60s and 70s. I would read *anything* immediately written by him. Like Graham and Train this is someone who really has a broad - and well-read - perspective on things.
* Jim Grant e.g. Mr Market Miscalculates. Wasn't totally sure about the Baruch biography.
* Liar's Poker and The Big Short by Michael Lewis
