Directions
Preheat the oven to 190C/gas5. Grease and line a 23x13x7cm cm (9x5x3in) loaf tin. Cream the butter and sugar. Add the eggs and vanilla, beating in well.
Next fold in the melted and cooled chocolate, taking care to blend well but do not overbeat.
You want the ingredients combined: you don't want a light airy mass. Gently add the flour, to which you've added the bicarb, alternately spoon by spoon, with 250 ml of boiling water until you have a smooth and fairly liquid batter.
Pour into the lined loaf tin and bake for 30 minutes. Turn the oven down to 170C/gas mark 3 and cook for another 15 minutes. The cake will still be a bit squidgy inside, so an inserted cake tester or skewer won't come out completely clean.
Plaace the loaf tin on a rack and leave to get completely cold before turning it out. It improves if left for a day or so before eating. This cake will probably sink in the middle because of its denseness.

# Sausage and lentil one pot

1 tbsp olive oil

400g pack sausage
1 onion, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed
1 red pepper, sliced
250g lentil (we used puy lentils)
150ml vegetable stock
125ml red wine or extra stock

Heat oil in a pan, cook the sausages until browned, then remove. Tip in remaining oil, onion, garlic and pepper, then cook, about 5 mins more until softened. Add lentils and sausages to the pan with the stock and wine, if using.

Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 20 mins until lentils have softened and sausages are cooked through. Serve with plenty of crusty bread.

# Hot Thai Stir Fry

Ingredients:
20 basil leaves
Grapeseed oil
350g chicken, cut into small pieces with skin left on
4 spring onions, roughly chopped
1 inch ginger, peeled and shredded
3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
2 red chillies, seeded and chopped
2 tblsp dark soy sauce

Method: 
Tear up the basil leaves and put them aside. Add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan and wait for it to heat up. When the oil starts to pop, drop in the chicken. Leave until the bottom side is golden, then flip until just cooked through. Remove from the pan and set aside.
Add a bit more oil to the pan. Put in the ginger, garlic and spring onions. Once soft, add the chillies. Once the chillies are also soft, add the chicken, and mix. Add the basil and soy sauce, and let cook for two minutes.
Serve on hot plates.
