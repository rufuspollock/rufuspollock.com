DataHub is the free, powerful data management platform from Open Knowledge International, based on the CKAN data management system.

<!--more-->Datahub provides free access to many of CKAN's core features, letting you search for data, register published datasets, create and manage groups of datasets, and get updates from datasets and groups you're interested in.

You can use the web interface or, if you are a programmer needing to connect the Datahub with another app, the CKAN API.
