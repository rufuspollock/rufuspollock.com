Frictionless Data is removing the friction in working with data by developing a set of tools, standards, and best practices for publishing data. The heart of Frictionless Data is the Data Package standard, a containerization format for any kind of data based on existing practices for publishing open-source software.

<!--more-->The frictions we in getting, sharing, and validating data stop people from truly benefiting from the wealth of data being opened up every day. This kills the cycle of find/improve/share that makes for a dynamic and productive data ecosystem.

We provide a simple wrapper and basic structure for transportation of data that significantly reduces the friction in data sharing and integration, supports automation and does this without imposing major changes on the underlying data being packaged.
