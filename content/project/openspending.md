OpenSpending is the largest open database of public financial information in the world, and maps spending in over 70 countries and more than 80 cities and regions around the world — from Belgium to Bosnia, Portugal to Puerto Rico.

<!--more-->OpenSpending is widely cited as one of the leading examples of how open data can be used to increase government transparency, including by web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee and and open movement champion Tim O’Reilly.

The database has helped journalists, civil society organisations and citizens around the world to explore and analyse spending in their country or region. The project is open source, and numerous other organisations and individuals have taken the code and created their own instances of the project — from Brazilian hackers to the Romanian government.
