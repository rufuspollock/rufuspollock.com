<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>One of the first printed texts of which we have record is a copy of the
   Buddhist Diamond sutra produced in China around 868AD.  In it can be found the
   dedication: &quot;for universal free distribution&quot;.  Clearly, the idea of public
   domain, that is open access to knowledge<sup id="fnr1-136464620"><a href="#fn1-136464620">1</a></sup>, has been present since humanity
   first began to formally transmit and share ideas. It is also likely that the
   urge to keep ideas secret, particularly those that had 'commercial' value, is
   equally old.
</p>
<p>With the development of trade and technology, particularly during the
   Renaissance in Europe, these parallel approaches of openness and secrecy
   continued to evolve but the tension between them also increased. With the
   introduction of formal monopoly rights such as patents and copyrights during
   the sixteenth and seventeenth century there was now a halfway house of sorts
   whereby the monopoly (and the associated profits) of secrecy was combined with
   openness in the form of the disclosure of the work.
</p>
<p>These alternatives of openness, secrecy and state-sanctioned monopoly have
   stayed with us down to the present day; while most of our ideas, particularly
   cultural ones, are 'public domain', free for anyone to use and reuse, a
   significant portion of the intellectual works and products created by the
   economies of the world are protected either by some form of intellectual
   property rights or by secrecy &ndash; or by both, as is the case with most
   proprietary computer software for example.
</p>
<p>However there have also been considerable changes. On the one hand there has
   been a large increase, particularly over the last thirty to forty years, in the
   scope and duration of intellectual property rights. On the other hand, and at
   the same time, especially in recent years, we have seen the rise of
   self-consciously open models of innovation, particularly in software where the
   'copyleft' approach to knowledge licensing first arose in the 1980s<sup id="fnr2-136464620"><a href="#fn2-136464620">2</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>However the most significant of all changes underlies these others, for it is
   the change in the role of knowledge in society and the economy. Terms such as
   the 'information age' or the 'knowledge economy' are now commonplace and hard
   statistics point to the fact that in most western economies the
   information-based service sector is now more important than manufacturing.
   These changes in turn result from, or at least depend upon, a revolution in
   communication and computer technologies that has greatly reduced the cost of
   production, distribution and manipulation of knowledge.  Whole industries which
   neither existed nor were imagined fifty, and possibly even twenty, years ago
   have grown up which exploit these new-found possibilities.
</p>
<p>What do these vast changes mean for the production and dissemination of
   knowledge, as well as for their regulation and support by government?  These
   are large questions and not ones that can be answered adequately here. Instead,
   we shall address a small part of this large picture by focusing on the public
   domain and its value to society, concentrating in particular on the way in
   which open, 'public domain', approaches can generate commercial as well as
   societal value.
</p>
<p>Too often this value has been unarticulated and thereby left vulnerable. While
   those who promote stronger intellectual property rights point to the tangible
   benefits that these offer their businesses, the corresponding costs to the
   public domain and its users are invisible or ignored. This paper seeks to
   redress the imbalance and, in doing so, to spur a re-orientation of innovation
   and information policy. Our current paradigm represents a form of monomania in
   which monopoly rights, in the form of intellectual property, displace all else
   from our thinking on this subject.  It binds us to a narrow, and erroneous,
   viewpoint in which innovation is central but access is peripheral. The system
   it has engendered is now so distorted that its social <em>and </em>commercial costs in
   several key areas have become large. It is therefore high time to restore
   balance, in particular by taking proper account of the public domain and open
   approaches to knowledge production.  It is only by doing so that we will be
   able to take full advantage of the possibilities offered by this digital age.
</p>

<h2>General Remarks</h2>
<p>We begin by making some general remarks which form a background for the set of
   case-studies and research which will follow.
</p>

<h3>The Concept of (Social) Value</h3>
<p>When we talk of 'value' it is important to be clear about what we mean. In this
   essay when the term value is used it should be taken as social value (or
   welfare), which is the usual meaning attributed to the term value by
   economists. This value, be it of an apple or a piece of software, is the value
   derived by a user from its employment or enjoyment &ndash; often approximated in
   monetary terms by willingness-to-pay (WTP)<sup id="fnr3-136464620"><a href="#fn3-136464620">3</a></sup> &ndash; net of the costs of producing
   the good. For goods with an associated price, social value may in turn be
   divided into 'user value' (consumer surplus) &ndash; defined as the value to the user
   of the good net the price paid for it &ndash; and 'commercial value' (producer
   surplus) &ndash; defined as the price minus the cost of producing the good (the
   seller's profit).
</p>
<p>Thus the value of a good may be quite different from the price paid for it.
   This is an important distinction to keep in mind, for it is not unusual to see
   the value of an activity being equated to its revenue rather than to the
   utility generated for society.  To illustrate this difference consider the case
   of a novel that goes out of copyright and enters the public domain. Suppose
   before this occurred the novel was sold for £10 in bookshops but afterwards it
   is sold for £5 and is also available for free on the internet.  Sometimes it is
   suggested that this results in a reduction in the value of that work for
   society since before the work was 'worth' £10 but now is 'worth' only £5 or
   even nothing.
</p>
<p>From the above this can be seen to be completely false. The value of the work
   has not changed at all. All that has happened is that the price has dropped. A
   consumer who previously valued the book at, say, £15 and who paid £10 and was
   left with £5 of 'consumer surplus', now pays £5 (or £0) and is left with £10
   (or £15) of 'surplus'.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the reduction in price means that consumers who valued the work at
   less than £10, and therefore did not buy at the original price, will now be
   able to purchase it. For each such consumer society gains the entire value they
   put upon the good (net of costs). Aggregating the valuations of all of these
   individuals who only get access at the lower price gives the total value to
   society of having this lower price. Conversely when a monopoly &ndash; or some other
   regulation &ndash; restricts access to a good there is a consequential loss to
   society (termed the deadweight loss).
</p>
<p>To give a concrete example, consider the case of pharmaceuticals in India.
   Since 1973 India has not had patents for pharmaceutical products. However under
   the TRIPs agreement &ndash; to which India is a signatory &ndash; patent protection must be
   provided for pharmaceuticals.  Patents are monopolies and therefore their
   introduction will result in a deadweight loss to society. A recent study
   (Chaudhuri et al.) sought to determine the magnitude of this loss. They
   estimated that this change will cost Indian society, via its effect on
   consumers and local manufacturers, between $350--500 million a year, but that
   the gain to the owners of the patents will be only $50 million a year. This
   implies a deadweight cost for these monopolies of $300--$450 million a year, a
   very significant sum.
</p>
<p>Moreover in the case of monopolies for knowledge we must also take account of
   the costs arising not just from the loss of access but from the loss of reuse.
   Just as some users are restricted from getting the good so will some innovators
   be prevented from building upon the original to make new products. If the
   monopoly acts as a significant bar in this respect the result will most likely
   be a large loss to society. A classic example of exactly this outcome is
   afforded by Watt and his improvement to the steam engine. Watt in partnership
   with Boulton vigorously enforced his patent against both infringers <em>and</em>
   improvers. This held up new developments and it was only with the expiry of his
   patent in 1799 that the flood of pent up innovation was released<sup id="fnr4-136464620"><a href="#fn4-136464620">4</a></sup>.
</p>

<h3>The Special Nature of Knowledge</h3>
<p>Knowledge is different from many 'normal' physical goods. It is different in
   being, at least approximately, costless to reproduce once the first 'copy' is
   made. This has profound consequences.  If I share a pair of shoes with you we
   don't create a new pair of shoes &ndash; in fact I now only have my shoes half the
   time. However if I share a piece of knowledge with you you have gained
   something and I have lost nothing. As Jefferson eloquently phrased it: &quot;He who
   receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine;
   as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me&quot;<sup id="fnr5-136464620"><a href="#fn5-136464620">5</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>In the economist's terminology this feature is known as nonrivalry.  It makes
   knowledge a good similar to traditional public goods such as national defense,
   the road network, or even the BBC, and it fundamentally alters how we approach
   its distribution: from the viewpoint of society, once a piece of knowledge is
   in existence the best thing to do is distribute it at cost (which may be zero
   or very close to zero).
</p>
<p>So why do we not always distribute knowledge at its marginal cost?  The answer
   is simple: we need to pay for the first 'copy' which unlike subsequent copies
   may be (very) costly. For example, developing and testing a new pharmaceutical
   may run into the hundreds of millions of pounds. Thus some way must be found to
   pay for or fund this first 'copy' and we may summarize the possibilities in
   four categories: 
</p>
<ol>
 <li><p>Up-front funding either by the state or by other entities &ndash; such as
      charities &ndash; followed by free (or marginal cost) distribution.  This is how
      the majority of basic scientific research is done today and it is similar to
      the funding of the BBC via a licence fee. It also accounts for a large
      proportion of the production of software much of which is bespoke and
      therefore commissioned<sup id="fnr6-136464620"><a href="#fn6-136464620">6</a></sup>.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Donated or self-financed with free distribution. This covers examples such
      as Wikipedia, blogs and many open source projects where the 'knowledge' is
      produced by people in their spare time.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>The grant of monopoly rights in relation to the copying or use of the
      knowledge in the form of intellectual property such as copyright and
      patents. Here the intent is that the grant of a monopoly will enable the
      creator to charge higher prices for the use of the good and thereby to earn
      sufficient monies to cover the initial costs of producing it.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Using imperfections of the market to obtain profit from being the creator of
      knowledge but without using monopoly rights.  Such methods include secrecy,
      first-mover advantages, marketing and the sale of complementary goods which
      are rival but for which an advantage is conferred by the production of the
      original knowledge. This area probably accounts for the majority of funding
      both at present and in history<sup id="fnr7-136464620"><a href="#fn7-136464620">7</a></sup>.
</p>

 </li>
</ol>
<p>These different methods are not always exclusive and usually several of them
   may be employed at once. For example musicians may sell their music under
   copyright (monopoly rights) but also sell tickets to concerts (complementary
   rival good)<sup id="fnr8-136464620"><a href="#fn8-136464620">8</a></sup>. The New York Times and the Guardian both give free access to
   their online edition but feature advertising as well as selling a corresponding
   print edition (complementary goods)<sup id="fnr9-136464620"><a href="#fn9-136464620">9</a></sup> .
</p>
<p>Thus while making knowledge open is optimal once it exists this may not be
   compatible with ensuring its creation in a first place.  When the first-best
   solution of up-front funding is impractical or inefficient we may have to make
   difficult trade-offs between the costs of restricting access and the benefits
   of providing creators with greater incentives to produce work. This tension
   poses difficult question for policymakers and is also central to the valuation
   of the public domain, to which we now turn.
</p>

<h3>Valuing the public domain (in theory)</h3>
<p>There are two possible methods by which we might value the public domain. The
   first is the simplest and consists of setting the value of the public domain as
   equal to the social value of all the works which make it up. The second,
   slightly more complex approach, is to calculate what might be termed the
   net value of the public domain: that is the social value generated by the
   contents of the public domain being public as opposed to private (that is
   either secret or covered by monopoly rights of some form) and with creation
   costs deducted (for example the cost of publicly funded research).
</p>
<p>To put this in concrete terms let us consider the works of Shakespeare which
   are in the public domain. Under the first approach we would take the value to
   be the full societal benefit gained from Shakespeare's work as it stands with
   free access for all. Under the second approach we would need to imagine a world
   in which Shakespeare's work was still covered by copyright and to subtract the
   value generated in that situation from that obtained in the first.
</p>
<p>In general we shall use the second 'net value' approach. One final point
   remains, namely to take account of the effect on the <em>production</em> of knowledge
   were the public domain 'privatized' (or conversely if some of the private
   domain were made public). Remember that the very purpose of private monopoly
   rights in this area is to increase the remuneration of creators so that more
   works are created. Conversely opening up knowledge may have positive effect on
   creativity by reducing transactions costs and the barriers to reuse for future
   creators. If these 'production' effects are large it is important that be taken
   into account.  There are two ways to do this. One approach is to subtract the
   total social value of the extra works that would have been created with a
   'private' public domain<sup id="fnr10-136464620"><a href="#fn10-136464620">10</a></sup>. Under the second we subtract the cost of those
   works under the assumption that it would be possible for society to find some
   way to fund them in an alternative manner (for example by government grants or
   using a levy). Let us term these the uncompensated and compensated value. In
   general, and unless otherwise stated, we shall use the compensated value.
</p>

<h2>Valuing the Public Domain in Practice</h2>
<p>In this section and the following we shall attempt to gauge the value of the
   public domain by examining it from several different perspectives and with
   several different pieces of data. No one of these perspectives is the only, or
   the correct one, but together they deliver a coherent picture of the social and
   commercial value of the public domain.
</p>

<h3>The Broad Public Domain</h3>
<p>In the most basic sense, a broad and deep public domain is essential to our
   cultural, intellectual and commercial lives. Imagine the situation if each time
   a teacher wished to tell her pupils about freedom of speech, or the history of
   the parliamentary system she needed to seek out the owner(s) of this piece of
   intellectual property and purchase the right to make the twenty-five copies
   required for her class<sup id="fnr11-136464620"><a href="#fn11-136464620">11</a></sup>? Not only teaching but most of our cultural and
   intellectual lives would grind to a halt.
</p>
<p>This vast 'public domain' of ideas, as well as much of the language in which we
   clothe them, is so omnipresent that we are often in danger of taking it for
   granted, especially when we start to discuss intellectual property. Yet it is
   the sea in which all else subsists, including those islands which represent
   works formally protected by one intellectual property right or another. As
   Isaac Newton said: &quot;If I have seen further than others it is because I have
   stood upon the shoulders of giants&quot; and it is no empty cliche that all work
   builds upon the past. Even a brief survey in any given area can find endless
   examples of direct or indirect borrowing from earlier works, and a broad and
   deep public domain which allows for free use and reuse is essential to this
   process.
</p>
<p>Can we quantify the extent of this benefit? The answer, at least with present
   data and modelling tools, is no. The public domain in this broad sense is
   simply too big. Trying to calculate the counterfactual as to what would occur
   should all of it be proprietary &ndash; each individual idea with an individual owner
   from whom one must seek a license for each reproduction, each alteration &ndash; is
   simply too far from common experience for us to conjecture even a rough
   estimate. Nevertheless there are three pieces of evidence which indicate that
   this value is large.
</p>
<p>First, the fact that most societies have, at the very least, firmly excluded
   general ideas (i.e. those without 'industrial application'), as well as
   mathematical algorithms and business processes<sup id="fnr12-136464620"><a href="#fn12-136464620">12</a></sup> from patentability
   indicates that the social costs involved in privatizing these types of
   knowledge outweigh the benefits.  Second is the fact that in all countries
   non-private sources (such as the government and charitable foundations) account
   for a substantial &ndash; and in some cases a majority &ndash; of expenditure on research
   and development<sup id="fnr13-136464620"><a href="#fn13-136464620">13</a></sup>. Combined with the extensive evidence on spillovers from
   public to private R&D, such figures clearly indicate that all societies
   identify significant benefits in maintaining a system of public R&D and open
   science, not only for its own sake but also to act as a complement to, and
   input into, private, commercial activities<sup id="fnr14-136464620"><a href="#fn14-136464620">14</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>Third is the growing body of evidence of the difficulties caused by the
   proprietization of science, particularly basic biomedical science, in the
   United States<sup id="fnr15-136464620"><a href="#fn15-136464620">15</a></sup>. For example, Cockburn (2005) concludes that &quot;[T]he
   extension of exclusionary intellectual property rights into basic research has
   unleashed a surge of entrepreneurial energy and risk taking in commercial
   science, with potentially very significant benefits to society once the
   technology reaches end-users. <em>But these benefits carry with them substantial
costs</em>: the patent-driven vertical struggle for rents within the biomedical
   innovation system may have generated important inefficiencies, waste, and
   misallocation of resources, ... Restrictions on access to research tools and
   data are likely to prove very costly in the long run, and stronger protection
   of the public domain may be a prerequisite for the future health of basic
   biomedical science.&quot;[emphasis added]<sup id="fnr16-136464620"><a href="#fn16-136464620">16</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>The combined effect of this evidence, tentative though some of it still is,
   makes a strong qualitative case for the commercial as well as social value of
   this 'broad' public domain. In the following sections we will be able to
   examine particular examples of open, public domain, approaches to knowledge, so
   as to form some quantitative, as well as qualitative, conclusions about its
   importance. Nevertheless this should not make us forget that it is this broad
   public domain which is undoubtedly the most significant to us as a society both
   socially, culturally and commercially.
</p>

<h3>Online File-Sharing</h3>
<p>Over the last five years a significant amount of economic research has been
   done on the effects of online file-sharing over peer-to-peer networks. Almost
   all such file-sharing has been illegal, and so it provides an interesting
   real-world experiment in the consequences of a partial suspension of copyright
   (at least in relation to music). This experiment gives us an opportunity to
   estimate, with 'live' data, both the potential gains to society in terms of
   increased access, as well the potential costs in terms of a reduction in the
   production of new works consequent upon a diminishment in the remuneration of
   creators. Putting these two results together will then give us, albeit
   indirectly, some sense of the value of a public domain approach in this area.
</p>
<p>This larger question is best addressed by dividing it into several smaller
   ones. First, does (illegal) online file-sharing increase or decrease legal
   sales? It has long been thought that there are two possible effects operating
   in this regard but in different directions. On the one hand there is a
   substitution effect whereby cheaper, but often lower quality, copies obtained
   via a file-sharing network 'substitute' for purchases of legal copies. On the
   other hand there is the 'sampling' effect, whereby the greater exposure to
   music resulting from the cheaper access via file-sharing increases purchases of
   legal copies.
</p>
<p>Second, what consequence would a decline in sales have on the output of
   creative works? Here there are several more factors to consider. First,
   increased exposure (the sampling effect again) may increase attendance at
   concerts and help to build a fan-base<sup id="fnr17-136464620"><a href="#fn17-136464620">17</a></sup> which in turn expands artists'
   revenue. Second, losses in sales do not translate one to one into changes in
   income for artists &ndash; or changes in label profit used to fund other artists:
   figures suggest approximately 16% of the value of an average CD goes in
   payments to artists while approximately 10% is label profit, with the rest
   being used up in paying for various overheads<sup id="fnr18-136464620"><a href="#fn18-136464620">18</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>Third, and this is the fundamental question for a policy maker, what is the
   overall result for society's welfare? On the one hand there is the increase in
   access because downloading from file-sharing networks is free or nearly free.
   This benefits society in that people gain access to, and get value from, works
   that they would not have purchased legally. These are the sales that would
   <strong>not</strong> have happened in the absence of downloading, so they represent no loss
   to the music industry (the production of these copies being virtually costless
   since it just involves the copying of bits &ndash; a fact that is the main reason why
   illegal downloading is fundamentally different from going into a shop and
   stealing something). On the other hand where downloads do displace legal sales
   there may be a reduction in the production of musical works (though this loss
   must be offset against the gains in other areas as consumers spend their money
   elsewhere, for example on DVDs).
</p>
<p>The research suggests several interesting answers to these questions. First,
   and most important, that the benefits of free access (or nearly free access)
   are very significant. Rob and Waldfogel (2004) &ndash; the only researchers to
   examine this question directly<sup id="fnr19-136464620"><a href="#fn19-136464620">19</a></sup> &ndash; find that by allowing 'public-domain'
   type access to music there would be <em>net</em> gains to society of around $45 per
   person &ndash; a very large sum indeed<sup id="fnr20-136464620"><a href="#fn20-136464620">20</a></sup>. Of course we must bear in mind that
   these gains are quoted 'net' on the assumption that creators have been
   compensated for any lost revenue. Thus we need to make some adjustments if we
   are to arrive at a true estimate of a public domain approach in this area.
   There are two points to make.
</p>
<p>First even if this assumption is untenable it is likely that the value of a
   more open, public domain, approach yields a positive value for society, since
   the impact on the production of new works, at least in present circumstances,
   seems likely to be quite small, for two reasons. First, though debate continues
   it would appear that the impact of peer-to-peer downloading on sales does not
   seem to be that high<sup id="fnr21-136464620"><a href="#fn21-136464620">21</a></sup>. Second the impact of file-sharing on actual creators
   &ndash; and therefore on creativity &ndash; is likely to be far smaller than the impact on
   sales, and may, in fact, be positive.<sup id="fnr22-136464620"><a href="#fn22-136464620">22</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>Second, and more importantly, it <strong>is</strong> plausible to assume that creators could
   be compensated for any loss in revenue by means of some form of 'up-front'
   funding system. For example Canada already has a broad private copying
   exception, which covers downloading from peer-to-peer networks, combined with a
   levy on items such as blank CDs, with the resulting revenue going to artists
   (Geist 2005). For Finland, Oksanen and Valimaki (2005) estimate that a 5 euro a
   month charge on broadband would be sufficient, and in the UK (as in much of the
   rest of the world) collecting societies are already operating similar schemes
   for the collection of copyright income in other areas<sup id="fnr23-136464620"><a href="#fn23-136464620">23</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>Thus these large 'net' gains of a public domain approach reflect real,
   realizable value. Furthermore these gains can, and should, be used to
   <em>increase</em> the remuneration of artists and funding for artistic works. The
   result would be a win-win situation of increased access <em>and</em> increased
   creativity, delivering social and commercial value as well as a freer and more
   dynamic creative industry.
</p>

<h3>Access to Older Works</h3>
<p>A second piece of data comes to us thanks to a recent report commissioned by
   the Library of Congress on reissues of sound recordings in the United States
   (Brooks 2005). The report is interesting because it studies a simple natural
   experiment. In the United States pre-1972 sound recordings are protected under
   State law until 
   2067. Thus the vast majority of recordings from that era are still protected by
   copyright. However in Europe, because of a shorter term for copyright
   protection of sound recordings, many earlier works are not protected. Thus
   there are two sets of people who can make available US works: rights-holders
   and others (either European firms who may legally do so or small US firms
   operating under the radar). According to theory we should see more reissues
   from rights-holders than others because they have easier access to the
   originals (unless they destroyed them &ndash; as many did) and a greater incentive to
   reissue recordings than non-rights-holders due to their monopoly position.
</p>
<p>The evidence however, as uncovered by this study, is the opposite.  Comparing
   reissues of older recordings by rights-holders and non-rights-holders, the
   study finds that non-rights-holders have reissued more historical recordings
   than rights-holders for every five-year period prior to 1945 (for every period
   prior to 1940 the ratio is over two to one). Furthermore for every period up to
   1964 (the end-date of the study) the majority (and usually the vast majority)
   of works had not been reissued by anyone and therefore are, to all intents and
   purposes, unavailable to the public<sup id="fnr24-136464620"><a href="#fn24-136464620">24</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>This data provides powerful evidence of the social and commercial value of the
   public domain. Public domain works are <em>more</em> likely to be made available to
   the public. Furthermore this access to older works generates value not only for
   the consumer but also revenue for the firms involved in re-issuing historical
   recordings, such as Naxos and Document Records. Older works gathering dust in
   vaults or even rotting away (as has occurred with a large amount of early film
   in the United States<sup id="fnr25-136464620"><a href="#fn25-136464620">25</a></sup>) generate no revenue or value for society, and
   represent a tragedy for any nation's cultural heritage.
</p>

<h3>Open Source</h3>
<p>In 2005 venture capitalists in Silicon Valley directed more than $150 million
   into open source companies<sup id="fnr26-136464620"><a href="#fn26-136464620">26</a></sup>. This was more than double the amount in 2004
   and ten times the amount of 
   2003. Major players in the industry such as IBM, Sun Microsystems, and Hewlett
   Packard actively use, support, and develop open source software and projects.
   At the same time surveys indicate that companies are looking to increase
   dramatically their usage of open source software in all areas from operating
   systems to productivity suites,<sup id="fnr27-136464620"><a href="#fn27-136464620">27</a></sup> and each week brings new announcements of
   the adoption of open source software at major institutions<sup id="fnr28-136464620"><a href="#fn28-136464620">28</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>But how is it possible that software supplied 'free' can be of such interest to
   commercial firms? A large part of the answer is supplied by the two century old
   example of John Rennie, one of the most famous engineers of the industrial
   revolution. In 
   1789 he worked on the Albion Mills for Watt and Boulton. To Watt's horror, upon
   completion, Rennie, rather than patenting his new design, was eager to
   demonstrate it to others. &quot;[F]ar from ruining him [Rennie] as Watt predicted,
   [this] established his reputation and led to a flood of commissions&quot;<sup id="fnr29-136464620"><a href="#fn29-136464620">29</a></sup>. The
   moral of the story is clear: asserting monopoly rights in a new work either via
   patent or copyright is not the only &ndash; or even necessarily the best &ndash; way to
   gain returns from it. A very large amount of software is bespoke, customized to
   its particular user's needs much in the same way as engineering projects were
   in Rennie's era. In these circumstances, just as in Rennie's day, open sourcing
   your efforts does not threaten future work and may actively promote it.
</p>
<p>This is not the only means by which firms and individuals appropriate returns
   from the development of open source software. Firms may offer complementary
   goods and services that are either rival (so priced normally like any other
   good) or proprietary. For example, IBM while supplying Linux (an open source
   operating system) for free, charge for the hardware on which it runs, as well
   as support and a range of consultancy services. Similarly the UK's Clocksoft
   software's payroll system is open source but they charge for the updates
   necessary to keep abreast of the Inland Revenue's regulations.
</p>
<p>Then there is the case of in-house open source development where the
   distinction between the user and producer has almost completely disappeared.
   Whilst much of this work is in the form of improvements or alterations of
   existing packages rather than development ab initio, nevertheless it represents
   a large part of the open source development that occurs. Since this kind of
   activity rarely generates direct sales from the originating firm it represents
   less observable commercial value but in terms of what it facilitates it has
   major importance (consider, for example, work done on maintaining IT systems in
   a major bank)<sup id="fnr30-136464620"><a href="#fn30-136464620">30</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>These examples should make clear the commercial value of open source, but they
   do little to help understand what the advantages of open source are, and why it
   may be preferred over a proprietary approach. There are two main factors.
</p>
<p>First, there are the benefits to the producer of a piece of software who gains
   the participation of a wider community when an open source approach is adopted.
   Proprietary code is normally secret and access is only permitted to the group
   of people directly working on it. With open source the code is open and anyone
   may look at it, run it and change it. Furthermore since it is freely available
   others will be willing to contribute their time and effort to the project
   knowing that they won't see what they have done 'expropriated' by the owner.
   Finally by allowing everyone, including end-users, direct access to the
   software, transaction costs, particularly of communication, may be
   substantially reduced. Together these features mean that an open source
   producer can reduce the costs &ndash; and improve the quality &ndash; of their software.
</p>
<p>The second factor is the various advantages to the user of the software in
   terms of lower costs, greater flexibility, more competition and less lock-in.
   Code, let us not forget, is a nonrival good. Therefore for users it makes sense
   for the good to be distributed for free and for development to be funded up
   front. Of course if there is a large diffuse user base up-front payments may be
   hard to coordinate, but where we are talking about governments or even large
   corporations the benefits of the open source model in terms of cost are large,
   even when free-riding is taken into account. Added to the direct advantages of
   lower costs are the increased flexibility and competition experienced with open
   source. As Jean Marie-Lapeyre, chief technical officer at the French Tax
   Agency, explained in discussing their move towards open source software: &quot;We
   can have a contract with any player to support open source products ... We are
   not dependent on any vendor ... [furthermore] It's good that we can make a
   modification or fix software [ourselves]. For example, Nagios [an open source
   host, service and network monitoring program] had a bug in it and we didn't
   have support from anyone, so two of our engineers fixed it&quot;<sup id="fnr31-136464620"><a href="#fn31-136464620">31</a></sup>. As the
   software industry matures these sorts of advantages will only grow in
   importance.
</p>
<p>Open source software delivers the tools of the information economy without
   locking the user, or a society, into a single product or vendor. It allows
   competition to flourish, taking advantage of a globalized world to decentralize
   and localize innovation.  Given its size, maturity and importance it is one of
   the most powerful examples of the benefits of an open, 'public domain',
   approach to the production of information goods, and any society wishing to
   succeed in the knowledge economy of the twenty-first century must heed the
   lessons it provides.
</p>

<h3>Two Examples of the Indirect Value of the Public Domain</h3>

<h4>The Internet and the World-Wide-Web</h4>
<p>The Internet, and the World-Wide-Web built on top of it, have transformed the
   world. Their impact on industry has been immense, both in terms of the new
   commercial opportunities created and in the potential for traditional firms to
   improve and streamline their activities. Yet the underlying technologies were
   developed for non-commercial ends: the Internet was funded by the Department of
   Defense in the US and the Web was developed by Tim Berners-Lee while working on
   the IT staff at CERN, and both generated no direct revenue for their creators
   (though indirectly they have received numerous appointments and awards). Thus
   one of the pre-eminent commercial opportunities of the age resulted from work
   funded up-front by the Government, and which, as a result, was open &ndash; a feature
   that was of prime importance in their success<sup id="fnr32-136464620"><a href="#fn32-136464620">32</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>This example illustrates several important points. First, the wealth enabled by
   the Internet (and the Web) is immense. Second, the Net is open, and while
   it is possible to envisage a proprietary Internet, it is clear that it would
   have grown less quickly, and been far less valuable to society<sup id="fnr33-136464620"><a href="#fn33-136464620">33</a></sup>. Third,
   much of the value of the Internet is indirect coming from what it enables in
   terms of other products, services and activities &ndash; think of a lawyer in London
   able to exchange emails with a colleague in Hong Kong, a scientist in London
   able to share her data with a collaborator in California, or a shop able to
   sell its goods online anywhere in the world. Fourth, innovation of the Internet
   and the Web has been phenomenally rapid, a fact that is again strongly
   associated with the openness of the underlying systems &ndash; and the associated
   process<sup id="fnr34-136464620"><a href="#fn34-136464620">34</a></sup>. Fifth and finally, almost none of those who have contributed to
   the development of these technologies has derived benefit by trying to own part
   of them (i.e. by asserting intellectual property) though they have often gained
   significant rewards in other ways. To summarize, this is a classic example of
   the value of the public domain in creating great <em>indirect</em> wealth, but doing
   so primarily in enabling activities that build upon or use the public domain
   material.
</p>

<h4>Google (et al.)</h4>
<p>Google, the provider of the planet's most popular online search engine, is
   perhaps the best known Internet company in the world.  With a market valuation
   in the tens of billions of dollars it is also one of the most successful. It is
   therefore the largest and most commercially successful open content company in
   the world even though it does not, at least at present, own any content at all.
   For Google derives the vast bulk of its present revenue from advertising. The
   'attention' that sells the advertising is itself generated from Google's role
   as a web search engine, the gatekeeper and organizer of the immense store of
   information that is the Web. Without the Web, Google, and the business model
   that supports it simply would not exist.
</p>
<p>Thus Google has only been possible because the information on the web<sup id="fnr35-136464620"><a href="#fn35-136464620">35</a></sup> is
   almost all open and anyone may freely access (and copy for their own purposes)
   the information posted on websites<sup id="fnr36-136464620"><a href="#fn36-136464620">36</a></sup>.  Imagine if right from the start the
   web had been 'closed', and each website had required payment as well as an
   agreement not to copy its contents<sup id="fnr37-136464620"><a href="#fn37-136464620">37</a></sup>. Search engines, at least in their
   present form, would not exist and we would have seen neither the benefits of
   the services they provide nor the revenues they generate.
</p>

<h3>Public Sector Information</h3>
<p>Weather and geographic data &ndash; and public sector information in general &ndash; may
   not be the first things that spring to mind when we think about the 'creative
   economy'. Nevertheless these areas raise similar issues and represent greater
   importance in terms of both national income and social value than, for example,
   the music industry. Furthermore we are fortunate in being presented with
   several natural experiments in the form of the differing approaches to the
   availability of public sector information, the most prominent of which is the
   contrast between the United States and the countries of the European Union.
</p>
<p>In the United States, there is a strong tradition of placing public sector
   information in the public domain<sup id="fnr38-136464620"><a href="#fn38-136464620">38</a></sup>. In Europe most countries restrict access
   to this data. For example, in the United Kingdom the records of parliamentary
   activity (Hansard) are under parliamentary copyright; government documents are
   under crown copyright; geographic data is owned by the Ordnance Survey, a
   trading fund, which prices on a cost-recovery (i.e. monopolistic) basis;
   weather data is controlled by the Met Office which is another a trading fund
   and therefore also prices at monopolistic rates.
</p>
<p>By examining the resulting outcomes for both commerce and society under these
   different approaches we can gain some measure of the benefits, or costs, of a
   public domain approach. The results are stark: a multitude of studies and
   research demonstrate the value of a public domain approach over a proprietary
   (cost-recovery) one.
</p>
<p>For example the European Union's own study on <em>Commercial Exploitation of
Europe’s Public Sector Information</em> (PIRA 2000) found that though US
   governmental expenditure was only approximately twice as much as for the EU
   (9.5 vs. 19 billion euros) the economic value generated was more than ten times
   as much (750 billion vs.
   68 billion euros). Though a rough and ready calculation, and allowing for the
   benefits of a unified market, this suggests a net value of a public domain
   approach to public sector information in the region of ten or hundreds of
   billions of euros &ndash; an enormous sum. Furthermore, PIRA concluded that though
   government departments (or related agencies) would lose money from distributing
   data at marginal cost for unrestricted reuse, overall government income would
   grow due to increases in tax revenue<sup id="fnr39-136464620"><a href="#fn39-136464620">39</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>Consider the case of the commercial weather industry in the US and Europe.
   While the two economies are of roughly the same size the US commercial weather
   industry is over ten times larger than Europe's while the nascent weather risk
   management industry is over a hundred times larger. A significant factor in
   these discrepancies is undoubtedly the fact that the US government makes a
   large amount of weather data available freely or at cost while most European
   governments do not &ndash; for example, in the US national daily observational data
   back to 1948 can be acquired at cost from the National Climatic Data Center.
   Furthermore, as Weiss points out, the &quot;weather risk management example also
   raises the question whether restrictive data policies can have 'ripple-on'
   effects on firms who could otherwise benefit from specialized services. The
   data generated by the weather risk management industry shows a sharp disparity
   in the value of risk instruments (primarily 'hedge' contracts, and increasingly
   insurance) between the US and the EU&quot;<sup id="fnr40-136464620"><a href="#fn40-136464620">40</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>More evidence is provided by a Dutch study conducted by the Netherlands
   Economic Institute and commissioned by the Ministry of the Interior.  It found
   that &quot;Prosperity effects will be maximized when data is sold at marginal cost.
   Marginal cost is defined as all costs related to the dissemination of public
   sector information ...  Although NEI only researched four datasets, they
   suggest that by extrapolating their results to all public sector information,
   enormous additional economic activity can be expected&quot;<sup id="fnr41-136464620"><a href="#fn41-136464620">41</a></sup>.  Another Dutch
   study performed by Dutch Federal Geographic Data Committee estimated that
   reducing the price of geographic data by 60% would lead to a 40% growth in
   annual turnover plus an increase in employment of 800 jobs. The study also
   concluded that consumers, as well as businesses benefited, due to lower prices
   and new products and services<sup id="fnr42-136464620"><a href="#fn42-136464620">42</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>Together this and other work clearly demonstrate there are large losses from
   restricting access to public sector information both in terms of transactional
   costs and the direct impact because of higher prices. Furthermore, much public
   sector information is itself repurchased by the government (for example
   approximately 60% of Ordnance Survey sales are back to UK local or national
   bodies and 50% of Met Office sales are to the Ministry of Defence) and so
   monopoly pricing simply moves costs around within the government apparatus
   rather than being true 'cost-recovery'. In addition, free access and reuse of
   basic PSI data frees up downstream firms to innovate in both products and
   services, and thereby to create new markets and value for society<sup id="fnr43-136464620"><a href="#fn43-136464620">43</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>Taken as a whole this makes a very strong case that the net value of a public
   domain approach is large. Moreover the benefits accrue not just to citizens
   generally but also to businesses and government.  Comparison with the US where
   such public domain policies already exist suggests that the long-run value to
   the UK alone of taking an open, public domain, approach to public sector
   information is likely to be substantial, running into the billions or even tens
   of billions of pounds (for Europe as a whole this is likely to be at least an
   order of magnitude higher).
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With the IT revolution of the last half-century it is now possible to
   distribute knowledge at costs that approach zero. At the same time these
   technological changes have greatly reduced the barriers to active participation
   in the creation and reuse of knowledge goods. The consequences for the public
   domain are equally vast.
</p>
<p>Today the print run of a scholarly monograph published by Cambridge University
   Press is still seven hundred and fifty copies, approximately the same as a
   first print run in 1800, yet the same book made available on the Internet can
   reach millions. An entire encyclopedia (Wikipedia), more read than the New York
   Times, larger and better quality than Britannica, free to access and reuse, can
   be created entirely by volunteers. When the BBC made available its versions of
   the Beethoven symphonies last year they recorded total downloads of around 1.7
   million copies in the space of a few weeks, numbers that dwarf any conceivable
   level of sales at usual retail prices.  Silicon valley venture capitalists now
   frequently fund open source startups and companies such as Google have erected
   multi-billion dollar businesses on the basis of open access to content.
</p>
<p>These examples, as well as associated research, demonstrate that the value of
   the public domain, both actually and potentially is high. This is not to
   disregard the role of monopoly rights such as copyright and patents in
   incentivizing and coordinating a significant amount of cultural and industrial
   creativity.  However it does suggest that promoting and expanding the public
   domain in several key areas would yield large benefits for society in the form
   of increased access, greater development of complementary goods and services,
   and the ability to decentralize and widen the innovation process. It must be
   remembered that where feasible and reasonably efficient methods of up-front or
   indirect funding exist, an open approach to knowledge will always be superior
   to one based on monopoly rights.
</p>
<p>Thus, as we enter the information age, where all that glitters may just be
   bits, we must stand ready to expand the public domain and promote a more open
   approach to the use, reuse and distribution of knowledge.
</p>

<h2>Policy Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
 <li><p>When formulating policy the key variable to consider should be social value,
     which is the sum of commercial value and user value, rather than commercial
     value alone (in economist's terminology: welfare rather than national
     income).
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>When looking at the value of knowledge goods in general, and the public
     domain in particular, policy makers should take account of the value
     generated by complementary products and services.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Historically, innovation policy, particularly in relation to intellectual
     property, is characterized by extensive rent-seeking activity and significant
     imbalances in power.  It is important that this be taken into account in
     policy making, for example by the provision of a clear set of principles that
     could safeguard groups that are poorly represented (such as the general
     public). The public domain while very important to society tends to lack a
     concentrated set of stakeholders to defend it, compared, for example, to the
     copyright-based industries.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>For some of the categories of works currently covered by copyright, for
     example music, the introduction of open access along with some form of
     alternative compensation system promises to deliver significant gains both to
     creators and to consumers.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Access and preservation of older copyrighted works is a significant problem
     and should be addressed. This could be done in several, potentially
     complementary ways, including: introduction of a registration requirement,
     orphan works provisions, and a reduction in copyright term.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>In areas such as open source software and technology standards the first
     principle should be &quot;do no harm&quot;. In particular, it is imperative that policy
     makers maintain, and strengthen, the exclusion of software and business
     methods from patentability.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>Make public sector information open. This is one of the most direct, and
     straightforward actions governments can take in promoting the public domain,
     and it is one that the available evidence suggests will have large benefits
     both to industry and to the general public.
</p>

 </li>
</ul>

     Traditionally the public domain has been defined as the set of intellectual works that can be copied, used and reused without restriction of any kind. For the purposes of this essay I wish to widen this a little and make the public domain synonymous with 'open' knowledge, that is all ideas and information that can be freely used, redistributed and reused. The word 'freely' must be loosely interpreted &ndash; for example the requirement of attribution or even that derivative works be re-shared, does not render a work unfree.<p>  This public domain is very large. It includes the contents of the traditional public domain such as works originally subject to monopoly protection but where the protection has expired, for example Shakespeare's plays which were once subject to copyright, as well as items never subject to protection, for example the theory of relativity. It also includes open source software and work released under (some) Creative Commons licenses. As such it consists of almost all of humanity's intellectual output up until the very recent present (for patented ideas it excludes approximately the last twenty years and for copyrighted works approximately the last one hundred years).<a href="#fnr1-136464620" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a>

     An interesting piece of indirect evidence in this regard comes from Regner and Barria (2005) who study the Magnatune music label. Magnatune, as well as allowing free downloads of low quality versions of songs, permits users to choose how much to pay (between $5 and $18) to download a high quality album.

It is interesting to note that patents in most industries are usually relatively low on the list &ndash; as Hall (2003) summarizes: &quot;In both the United States and Europe, firms rate superior sales and service, lead time, and secrecy as far more important than patents in securing the returns to innovation.

     It is, of course, possible for this to be the other way around: that is there are works that exist under a public domain scenario but not under the private one (for example as a result of transaction cost and holdup problems).  In fact, when considering the case of works subject to copyright we can be certain that, at least in present circumstances, the production effects of privatizing the public domain would be negative. This is because extending copyright to an infinite term would provide no extra incentives for creators - copyright is already so long (life plus seventy years) that the difference in income provided by the two terms is essentially zero - but would inhibit those who seek to build upon and reuse the works of the past.<a href="#fnr10-136464620" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a>

     OECD (2005) figures indicate that in 2004 private firms accounted for approximately 53% of total expenditure R&D with the remainder coming from public sources. In the USA and Japan the private share is higher at 63% and 74% respectively. In Latin American by contrast the public share is the majority (NSF 2000).<a href="#fnr13-136464620" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a>

     Oberholzer and Strumpf (2005) &ndash; whose study is one of the most comprehensive to date, find no overall impact on sales, as do Le Guel and Rochelandet (2005) with their French dataset. At the other end of the spectrum Blackburn (2004) finds very large negative effects of up to 100% of the sales decline in past years (though there are reasons to suspect upwards bias in his results due to the methodology used). Several other studies, Rob and Waldfogel (2004), Hong (2004), Zentner (2003), find intermediate effects. Finally there is the fact that world-wide music sales increased substantially in 2005 while the number of users on peer-to-peer networks had continued to increase (at double the level in 2003).<a href="#fnr21-136464620" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a>

 <li id="fn22-136464620">
     As already mentioned the majority of the price of a piece of music goes into 'overheads' and does not flow directly or indirectly to creators.  Furthermore the impact of changes in sales may be asymmetric, for example Blackburn (2004) while estimating the largest overall loss also found that the bottom three quarters of artists (measured by income from music sales only) <strong>gained</strong> from online file-sharing. Finally most artists in the music industry earn the majority of their income from non-copyright sources such as live performance or commissions (Connolly and Krueger 2005, Kretschmer 2005). These facts are reflected in the surveys of artists themselves which indicate fairly divided views regarding the impact of file-sharing with almost equal numbers of artists seeing it as positive and negative (Pew 2004).<a href="#fnr22-136464620" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a>

     Awareness of this dependence is now fully recognized not just by Google with their Google Print project (see following footnote) but by corporations such as Yahoo!, Microsoft and Adobe who have joined the Open Content Alliance which seeks to digitize and make freely available large amounts of material (As part of this effort Microsoft is working with the British Library to digitize one hundred thousand of their out-of-copyright books <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4402442.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4402442.stm</a>)<a href="#fnr36-136464620" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a>

     Some idea of the problems that would have arisen is provided by the recent disputes surrounding the Google Print project. Google's plan was to digitize large numbers of books and then allow users of their search engine to search inside the books. The results of a search would only be small snippets of a sentence of two in length around the keywords provided by the user and the search result would allow a user to 'click-through' and purchase the book.  However the American Association of Publishers have opposed the move seeking compensation for the 'copying' involved, and last October filed suit after after negotiations broke down between the two parties.  <a href="http://publishers.org/press/releases.cfm?PressReleaseArticleID=292">http://publishers.org/press/releases.cfm?PressReleaseArticleID=292</a> <a href="http://news.com.com/Publishers+sue+Google+over+book+search+project/2100-1030_3-5902115.html">http://news.com.com/Publishers+sue+Google+over+book+search+project/2100-1030_3-5902115.html</a><a href="#fnr37-136464620" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a>

     &quot;The evidence that much PSI should be made available in a manner similar to the American pattern is quite compelling. The model described in Section 2.12.3 shows that the tax revenues produced by this approach may yield considerably more when the market grows. We believe this does not reflect the full benefits to all parties in the equation, and there is likely to be a more substantial growth if a marginal cost model is applied wherever possible.&quot; PIRA (2000) p.104.<p>   Very similar conclusions are reached by KPMG's study in relation to Canada (KPMG 2001). See, for example, their recommendation on copyright and licensing (24ff.) which concludes &quot;Digital geospatial data should be licensed at no royalty cost to users with respect to use and redistribution. Use copyright and licensing within Canada to protect quality of geospatial data originating from all government agencies, particularly at the federal level, rather than to prevent use.
