Iâ€™m easy to get in touch with via email ðŸ“¨. My email is checked and read regularly. My word is to answer all inquiries in my inbox ðŸ“¥ promptly, and at most within a week in normal circumstances.

<a href="mailto:hello@rufuspollock.com">hello@rufuspollock.com</a>

There is a spam filter and it can make errors. If you don't get a response promptly feel free to follow up (the second one usually gets through even if the first one did not ).

I also have various other points of presence online (see social media links). However, these may be checked irregularly so *email is generally far the best way to contact me* ðŸ˜€
