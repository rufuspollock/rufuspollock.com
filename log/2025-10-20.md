Astonished how bewildering DAM pricing is. E.g. just looked imgix page again https://www.imgix.com/pricing I need a PhD to understand the options ... how many credits will i need, how much will that be at $0.40 per credit on the starter plan ($25 / month) vs $0.30 per credit on the basic plan ($75 a month) ???

I continue to [[ideas/SimpleDAM|dream of a simple app]] where i can just upload an image and i can either bring my own storage or (better) just get charged what it costs them (plus a small markup or fixed cost for the app layer on top).

*The ironic meta-context here is i wanted to take a screenshot of imgix pricing page to illustrate ... and for that i wanted somewhere to store the image (because image storage in my local digital garden doesn't go well with git ...).*
